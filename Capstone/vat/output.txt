The catch yourself electron beam as a young driver that early on so you can you can show me what job and we saw a little bit about what you can do when when Lewis got.
Code in the address bar I reckon he was funny and.
That indicated not not the only in the guest house very very good job roughly so he's done is on there if you know the same family but now he'll be fully into Kansi in the hot seat now right alongside hoping you know but winning is driver in his group.
Yes %HESITATION he certainly services apprenticeship has may tell us a bit about him %HESITATION no British line of a course for them so what we bring to the team's.
%HESITATION I believe brilliant normally matters only managed very futuristic right side intelligent young man he's currently being.
And shop mind and and.
Balance you know bouncing kind of eagerness and thinking about.
Thanks same department feels well good team player.
Yep it is obviously his chance comes %HESITATION consult three both us %HESITATION is moving on one nine races in five years since he joined Mercedes in twenty seventeen %HESITATION good back up %HESITATION Hamilton wasn't interested in see that %HESITATION Lewis called in the best team made in work with which %HESITATION considering who is work with with an interesting statement what did you make of that and help difficult will be doing to replace you know Louis and had a very nice position in in the best car and make it use it but I mean battery is not the same pressure on in there Niko deal pass somebody's other teammates like when I go along so Jenson button and so you know about trees is going to carry on and he is very fine driver course that's you know the same thing happened to the future and Louis besides he went one more chance yet twenty might lose his appetite for M. decided to go they need to have top stars they think they've seen hedge their bets on it by putting %HESITATION Jordan actually it's one of the bright spots Dada form one yes it is interesting is it is it different characters and different teams are you talking about Niko in Jensen perhaps but in more pressure on him to some drivers like to have a team mate they put pressure on the men anything Lewis will one A. then therefore likes ones that don't.
I slept I think it's sometimes you'd like to be able to take on the battle against another opponent to another team without the interference on your own teammates you want to support rather than.
You know to be undermined and.
It might be I found myself sometimes five minutes email and Michael sheen back which was plenty of battles to fight but %HESITATION you look back at the sport something great.
Right rich the way to make your name is coming to a team and and not locked up someone like generating out of things so %HESITATION when Alan brush arrived you know Nikki realised he had a very very %HESITATION quick read teammate Brady still be doing that and he uses experience those those factors to bury interesting to watch you know a quick word on factory protests as well of the alpha remain now commute right and then %HESITATION retiring the domino effect in F. one if it is wonderful to watch from the outside.
How will both get on their dealings but it's not companies like what the %HESITATION transfers in football we we don't have that many seats he was thinking about it's only one match work they've %HESITATION players in our game %HESITATION you know with twenty drivers so he's gets very nice as possible so you.
No one moved someone has to go out and you know Jamie has had a fantastic young career career go on quite a long time he does so you know one person leading is great.
