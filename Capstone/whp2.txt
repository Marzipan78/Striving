uh meeting people dapping hands

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.360

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.320

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.600

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.960
i'm stressed okay

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.680
um anyways is there something you want

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.120
to tell us is that is that no i'll tell

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.680
you

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.960
okay uh well yeah so i got i got a bit

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.600
ill

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.199
couldn't do anything for like four days

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.840
five days um

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.880
and that was in the podcast

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.439
era so yeah we didn't manage to do it

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:12.799
well so the conversation was like we

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:13.360
were gonna

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.600
maybe do uh an episode on discord but

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.560
we've kind of said

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.320
after you know covered the first big

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.840
lockdown after we came back we got the

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.240
studio

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.840
well the setup done and now the new

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.439
studio on the way we kind of want to

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.200
avoid doing discord episodes if we can

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.400
help it sometimes obviously in the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.520
future we're going to have to there's

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.640
there'll be circumstances where we still

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.079
have to do discord but if we can't help

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:31.280
it i think it's better to

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.960
maybe delay it a week and then film it

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.799
in person properly um because we're just

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.000
trying to make sure the podcast just

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.280
keeps hitting new heights so we were

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.720
like we could do it on discord but it'll

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.439
be rushed

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.840
and sam was still feeling ill anyway um

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.799
so we're like you know what let's just

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.560
take a week off come back when um when

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.759
it hit when it's strong and also we had

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.360
jj's album coming out as well so

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.720
it's nice to you know kind of get that

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.479
focused and uh maybe the next episode

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:51.600
which is this one we can talk about that

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.320
as well so

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.320
i mean even even talking for like an

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.360
hour and a half was

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.560
i was like i can't do this i didn't

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.399
record your film yeah then stream for

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:59.520
six days

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.399
i didn't record i missed four days and

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.200
if you don't film

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.640
something's wrong i've never all the

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.960
time i've never not uploaded

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.080
i think the most i've missed on my

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.479
second channel is two days that's

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.200
imaginary

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.319
ever and that's eight years i mean

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.120
i mean uploads all the time i'm so lazy

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.319
and you posted

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.200
you weirdo yeah i did yeah yeah did you

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.239
i don't know

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.000
well i'll chat in a bit well since then

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.560
um we had the euros we haven't done one

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.840
since the semi-finals no

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.959
also that was the fact that that was a

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.400
fact as well it was from the day after

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.200
england

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.840
lost the euros and like everyone you

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.239
were

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.959
did you wake up depressed yeah i did it

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:39.680
all

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.040
it was very it was just really like

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.040
it sucked it's horrible like like

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.879
regardless of like oh you know we lost

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:47.360
like

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.280
that's hard to take it actually just

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.200
felt like it felt like everything just

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.480
kind of sucked it's just a way

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.200
in and obviously the way it is is the

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.720
way it is but it felt like the way it

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.080
was just was worse

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.080
yeah um i'm sure we'll get into like

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.440
some subjects later on

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.280
regarding the euros but it's just like a

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.640
dead feeling wasn't it

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.879
yeah was that you know when we lost to

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:07.680
croatia

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.599
that was different that was more like

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.519
we were all angry yeah because it was

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.200
like oh you know we could have won that

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.400
oh but we

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.640
[ __ ] up this one yes we we could have

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.000
won obviously it went to penalties

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.640
secondly

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.239
uh you know we were one ill up yeah and

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.799
then we just kind of sat back a bit but

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.879
it it just felt like it felt like it's

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.239
because it was so close

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.159
yeah that's right yeah and yeah we

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:32.159
weren't angry at anyone it was like well

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.400
you know i mean some people were angry

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.599
some people were angry yeah

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.840
shame on you shame on you it was just

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.200
like it just was what it was like it was

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.680
like

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.120
it was not you can't blame anyone like

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.120
we had a great run the players did

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.159
everything they could have the manager

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:45.519
did everything he could have the country

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.120
was really happy in terms of like

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.000
the overall run it was kind of like well

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.959
there's just nothing

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.959
it just got halted yeah yeah it was like

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.519
oh oh we're doing it

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.439
what happened yeah what happened

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:58.640
whatever you say about the game itself i

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.000
think both teams could have won like

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.400
they both

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.920
but both if anyone won they would

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.599
deserve to win no no but like

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.040
usually like if even one would have

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.480
deserved to win if italy won they would

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.360
have deserved to win

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.519
yeah so and whoever scores more goals

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.280
normally wins

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.370
cheers mclaren

though that wasn't yeah that was sick

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.520
unreal that was that probably was the

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.800
best best game

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.280
over them all yeah i mean the final

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.800
obviously was

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.160
a different vibe because it was yeah of

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.080
course yeah but i actually preferred

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.080
the atmosphere and also i was sat in a

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.280
different place yeah we were in

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.919
atmosphere

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:44.000
also the german fans as well it was it

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.280

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.199
that was that was a that was a great day

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:49.520
that

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.680
that one yeah not the next one i had to

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.120

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.520
the game just because i don't have like

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.199

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.120
not really well i've just hoped not

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.800
but what i'm saying is when you watch

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.840
premier league it doesn't really matter

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.360
you know if someone scores

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.960
worse is you see like someone texts in

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.720
the group doesn't it matter yeah um

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.000
if you if you care that much turn your

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.840
phone off whereas

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.080
for the euros if if anyone scored no

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.120
matter what tv was

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.680
i would hear it from a flat oh laura

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.800
would hear it from the flat so when we

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.840
went to the football she would always

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.960
hear her shout out and text me what's

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.680
happened

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.960
obviously she watched the files in the

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.639
later games but so i was like right i

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:39.840
can't watch the final in my flat because

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.120
no matter what happens i'm going to hear

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.840
something

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.600
um because i don't i don't watch the

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.360
direct source i watch it on like bbc

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.039
iplayer or whatever so i was like right

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:48.400
i have to go drive to someone who has

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.039
the game

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:50.400
my brother had it but then like you know

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.360
i think his kids are going to watch the

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.319
first half

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:54.479
and um you know they've got neighbors

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:55.759
and i will take it seriously i don't

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:56.639
want to be like screaming in front of

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:58.319
the kids yeah especially

00:06:58.319 --> 00:06:59.840
the kids are kind of like yeah whereas

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:07.039
you are [ __ ]

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:08.800
you know so yeah i just decided to drive

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.160
to my dad's my mum and dad

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.560
um and watch it there and that was hard

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.160
watch great great watch but

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.560
at the end it was just depressing yeah

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.440
so we've

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.199
we've moved on uh from the euros

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:22.880
kind of what we'll say as well we're

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.400
going to talk about is this is this the

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:24.960
chat now

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.199
about euros unless you want to know

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:28.160
because i always start the podcast i'm

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.199
always like this is what's to come and

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:30.000
then we start getting into

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.440
it and i'm like this is now this is now

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.199
it so what i will say is

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:36.479
i do think however that i know it's

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:36.960
gonna hurt

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.199
saying this and it's gonna be it's gonna

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:40.960
sound wrong but it's like an open-minded

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:41.440
thought

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.960
i think always losing especially in the

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.720
way we did was kind of like

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.680
good for the country and good for

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.520
longevity and it's good in the fight

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.960
against racism

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.879
in total obviously you can't really take

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:55.280
that you know it's bad what happened but

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.919
i feel like everyone together because of

00:07:57.919 --> 00:07:58.479
it

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:01.520
and the backlash that obviously like

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.599
because of the like people tweeting et

00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:05.599
cetera everyone kind of united a bit

00:08:05.599 --> 00:08:06.000
more

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.280
yeah yeah of course i wish raisins

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.879
wanted a thing anyway like i'm not happy

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:10.319
it happened because if it didn't happen

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:11.599
it didn't happen that'd was great

00:08:11.599 --> 00:08:13.280
but it was just masking it yeah i think

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.360
like it's stuff like this just

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.039
if if the players can like band together

00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:18.319
and if we as a country combined together

00:08:18.319 --> 00:08:19.599
it tackles it

00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:21.840
at a larger scale yeah more so than if

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.960
we'd win because i feel like the people

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.199
who have a go people who are racist like

00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:26.639
they they're just jealous and insecure

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:28.400
people as a whole so what i'm saying i

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.520
don't want them to celebrate

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.120
when you know say stack of scores a

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.719
penalty i don't want them to be happy

00:08:32.719 --> 00:08:34.399
there you know with themselves being a

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:35.519
racist but just not

00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:37.440
you know you want them to be out

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.800
basically yeah i want you to feel bad

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.159
make sense yeah i get that

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:43.200
but obviously no of course i still like

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.480
to win but

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.519
yeah of course i still want to win but

00:08:45.519 --> 00:08:46.800
i'm happy to see that you know you see

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.320
rashford and sancho on the plane like

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.080
rapping with like the jury on that was

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.399
an old clip was it i was like

00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:53.839
apparently it was a year old i've

00:08:53.839 --> 00:08:55.680
invaded yeah but then well all the

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.480
players i think

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.399
that's why i saw the comments devon rice

00:08:58.399 --> 00:08:59.519
makes them out jumping off boats and

00:08:59.519 --> 00:08:59.839
stuff

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:01.040
everyone everyone's happy and i feel

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.480
like that group of players has really

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.040
done well

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.200
um and i think you know i think it's

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.640
been great the you know the support that

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.160
the players have had you know i was

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.560
really surprised about right so

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.120
that was on the sunday like two or three

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.160
days ago

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.000
i went and helped theo film something it

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.440
was a football thing i was wearing an

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.839
england shirt yeah i had three people

00:09:19.839 --> 00:09:21.519
telling me to take the shirt off and not

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:23.600
in a sexual way not like oh baby take

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.640
that shirt off

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.880
not like that they literally say it like

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.240
one of them literally yeah exactly yeah

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.519
one of them literally was just like are

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:30.320
we lost what

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.600
what why are you wearing that take it

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.440
off she'd be more proud and i was like

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.600
would you like how is this how's the

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.800
thing i hate it like

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.640
england haven't ceased to exist because

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.920
yeah yeah yeah yeah

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.680
and that's again it felt different this

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.279
time like obviously it hurt more

00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:44.560
but also it felt better because it's

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.320
like oh we didn't deserve to lose we

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.360
just lost you know

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.800
so i i think in the world cup we're

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.680
gonna be even better you gotta remember

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.800
these players are young as well and

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.839
after what happened they're gonna be

00:09:51.839 --> 00:09:52.800
stronger as well they're gonna have more

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.279
of a

00:09:53.279 --> 00:09:55.279
point to prove and a great group of

00:09:55.279 --> 00:09:56.399
people and that's why i think

00:09:56.399 --> 00:09:58.399
i saw people saying like uh southgate

00:09:58.399 --> 00:09:59.680
come out india's i'd love to be able to

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.959
host a team and for the world cup i'm

00:10:00.959 --> 00:10:02.320
like why is that even a thing like

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.240
first managing what 55 years to take you

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.600
know to take the team to a major

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.040
championship and you can tell that like

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.079
no matter what you think of him

00:10:08.079 --> 00:10:09.600
tactically you can tell that the group

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.480
of players

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.480
like respect him a lot and the group the

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.320
the ethos we've got is so good there

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.399
confidence is high free players doing

00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:17.519
whatever they want to do you know

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:19.279
it seems like a very nice camp to be

00:10:19.279 --> 00:10:21.200
involved in whereas before you had like

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:21.760
you know

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.440
we could actually dice as a manager like

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.200
that that would have been just you know

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.880
taking the whole country back a bit but

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.720
now i'm really excited for the

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.440
players and i'm happy for them yeah yeah

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.279
i think that is the euros talk now

00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:35.120
yeah it was done guys yeah yeah and it

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.240
was a very abstract thought as well i'm

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.440
not saying that i'm not glad it happened

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.720
i'm just saying that like you know

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.079
i know what you mean as people i think

00:10:40.079 --> 00:10:41.600
it does just you know it's not just

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.720
football now it's it's

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.800
as as a freight not a race is it what

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.800
yeah as a human race it like progressed

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.279
progresses what's important

00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:52.880
which is not racism by the way we never

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.800
talk about stuff that's deep

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.880
but no it's very new for the podcast

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.839
it's an important one obviously we

00:10:57.839 --> 00:10:58.959
didn't talk about last week last week

00:10:58.959 --> 00:10:59.440
would have been

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.000
would have been like really angry all

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.440
you know all the idiots in the world but

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.720
now it's more like a reflection and

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.560
thinking like sorry i'm you sound like

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.280
ksi ad-libs

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.920
[Music]

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.959
oh man but another supporting event uh i

00:11:14.959 --> 00:11:15.920
went to the f1

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.920
oh yeah and i'm not a big f1 fan

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.040
i have many times said i find it a

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.000
little bit boring yeah

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.839
we have been to formula e together we

00:11:25.839 --> 00:11:29.600
have been formula e

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.640
yeah but i went to formula one because

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.760
uh team quadrant big up lando norris

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:36.160
team

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.000
did you say to them can canada come to

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.200
podcast

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.600
i didn't [ __ ] he can basically do stuff

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.839
in the winter is what we found out

00:11:43.839 --> 00:11:46.880
when he's okay like so he's not allowed

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.760
to see people so after the after the

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.240
race

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.279
he wasn't allowed to come get a drink

00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:53.040
with us i'm mad that he has to stay in a

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.480
box

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.320
vic's not in he got a phone no so vic

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.519
was in so

00:11:57.519 --> 00:11:59.920
basically say the thing is like a circle

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.920
yeah the whole venue is a circle

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.240
in the middle is the green zone

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.680
everywhere else is the red zone

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.320
right if you leave the green zone you

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.320
can't go back in you're contaminated

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.720
so vic was in the green zone with he

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.160
went with like i think channel four

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.440
yeah uh so he was in there he wasn't vic

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.560

more

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.199
yeah i mean like if someone invited me

00:14:53.199 --> 00:14:56.160
to a football match yeah for example

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.920
like like when you get into the

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.320
semi-finals stuff like that like euros

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.480
it is very you know you love football

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.160
yeah f1 was very

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.160
out of character yeah convention if you

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.199
if you were there and then someone at

00:15:07.199 --> 00:15:08.399
home was like oh man

00:15:08.399 --> 00:15:10.639
i'm a massive f1 fan although i think

00:15:10.639 --> 00:15:11.440
you know the

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.440
incidence of f1 you know obviously uh

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.880
verstappen and hamilton haven't

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.160
come together i don't know whose fault

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.600
it i i don't know i don't know enough

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.240
about the sport

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.320
but what he is doing to me is making me

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.440
more interested in the sport

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.519
yeah i'm like oh that's kind of cool i'm

00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:24.880
not sorry sorry hold on

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.000
it wasn't cool that van gogh

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.320
hospitalized but it was like an event

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.560
no i mean ever everyone around me was

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.240
saying there was a lot of people around

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.320
me who weren't like massive f1 fans they

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.600
all liked it but they weren't massive

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.800
fans yeah

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.959
is it bad that i kind of want them to

00:15:38.959 --> 00:15:40.160
crash i know

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.720
i was like everyone does they everyone

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.320
wants everyone to be safe

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.360
yeah of course but you want to see

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.040
someone spin out you well you want to i

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:47.519
think

00:15:47.519 --> 00:15:49.519
so a lot of people like i think this in

00:15:49.519 --> 00:15:50.959
f1 is a very big topic right now

00:15:50.959 --> 00:15:51.920
everyone's like oh

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.079
um hamilton should have done that

00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:55.199
whereas other people are saying you know

00:15:55.199 --> 00:15:56.880
max always drives quite aggressively so

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.240
it was going to happen eventually

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:58.959
whether it was

00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:00.480
maybe hamilton who's found out or max

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.560
who's for now or sorry not spent out

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.360
got hit but at the same time um yeah

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.240
it's like

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.279
people want to see people want to see

00:16:07.279 --> 00:16:08.480
them go head-to-head so if you want to

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.079
see those like close calls those actual

00:16:10.079 --> 00:16:11.279
like intense moments

00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:12.639
yeah and that's that again is a

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:14.000
spectator sport right like like all

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.920
sports are so i think you know

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.560
yeah yeah but then the ending of it was

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.160
mental i don't know if you have yeah

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.079

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.959
well hamilton got a 10 second delay yeah

00:16:26.959 --> 00:16:27.440
was in

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.440
fifth or sixth or something yeah and

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.440
then he had something like

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.399
eight laps or no 13 laps and had to make

00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:35.519
up 10 seconds

00:16:35.519 --> 00:16:37.920
mad and it was like every lap so we're

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.440
on this corner it was called

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.800
brooklyn's corner baby now brooklyn

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.399
all right yeah like brook land now just

00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:47.600
singing jay-z didn't ask

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.360
we're on a corner that's like a almost

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.880
like an s yeah

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.920
and every lap you just see hamilton that

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.839
little bit closer yeah that's so amazing

00:16:55.839 --> 00:16:57.519
it was you know it was started off 10

00:16:57.519 --> 00:16:59.440
seconds apart yeah the next lap he's oh

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.320
he's nine

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.920
that is now he's eight and it was

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.440
amazing that was amazing

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.120
that's where like f1 becomes enjoyable

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.480
like on the surface if you're not into

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.039
the sport

00:17:07.039 --> 00:17:09.120
it seems very boring doesn't it like the

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.400
the start's really great the end's

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.520
really great but it's like

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.679
why are everyone so into it for the rest

00:17:13.679 --> 00:17:14.880
of it but i think it's the data isn't it

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:15.439
like

00:17:15.439 --> 00:17:16.880
the seconds that they can shave off you

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.959

00:17:18.959 --> 00:17:19.839

which apparently you're in draft to

00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:22.880
survive and they're quite funny

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.600
oh okay so yeah they came last yesterday

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.480
yeah yeah

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.919
they were the team that toby started

00:18:27.919 --> 00:18:29.919
supporting them um

00:18:29.919 --> 00:18:31.360
when they were already losing yeah when

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.840
they got lapped and they had been lapped

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.120
by like three people

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.799
and then a couple laps later they've

00:18:36.799 --> 00:18:38.559
been that by four yeah yeah yeah by five

00:18:38.559 --> 00:18:39.919
lap by six well

00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:42.480
i from what i've heard they are amazing

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.440
it's just the cars

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.440
yeah but also no so may's pin one of

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.480
them he's not even

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.160
like a i mean he's a f1 racer obviously

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.760
but his dad just like owns a team or it

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.280
does like mega rich oh really

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.960
like russian dynamics my brother's

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.320
telling me that anyway so just

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.160
she bought a spot in the team she just

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.600
always laughs back

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.000
he's just sat there like driving along

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
like airports

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.919
yeah yeah i think of course like mclaren

00:19:03.919 --> 00:19:05.039
and all the teams they back they buy

00:19:05.039 --> 00:19:06.559
into the f1 similar to how a lot of

00:19:06.559 --> 00:19:08.240
other sports things work so i guess

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.440
where you got hamilton he could

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.120
obviously get sponsored at a younger age

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.240
because he's so talented you know and

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:12.559
they

00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:14.000
pay for him to get his spot in yeah

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.360
whereas this bloke's just like i don't

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.640
know

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.080
the fact that someone spun out and like

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.440
you had to recover you still come in

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.039
like last just

00:19:21.039 --> 00:19:23.039
this is a heads up neither of us know

00:19:23.039 --> 00:19:24.400
anything yeah i could be absolutely

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.200
completely wrong

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.799
yeah if we've said anything wrong take

00:19:26.799 --> 00:19:28.720
it with a pinch of salt yeah

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.160
or you know and if you do something put

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.679
something in the comments make it like a

00:19:31.679 --> 00:19:32.799
construction yeah constructive yeah

00:19:32.799 --> 00:19:34.160
because we want to get into it and

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.440
if you're a f1 fan you want to be

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.280
accepting newcomers and one day we'll

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.000
learn so shut

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.960
up that's what i hate i hate people that

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.240
are like oh

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.000
uh you shouldn't be going if you don't

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.440
like it and i'm like well i mean i did

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.080
offer it to

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:50.080
everyone else first and also i

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.760
i haven't got into it yeah everyone

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.360
starts somewhere but yeah i haven't got

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.720
into it by watching it on tv

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.799
or anything like that but me going to

00:19:56.799 --> 00:19:57.760
this one event

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.919
has now made me actually go oh when's

00:19:59.919 --> 00:20:00.880
the next one on like

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.159
i'll actually watch it yeah and then

00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:03.760
obviously f1 is a huge sport but it's

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.280
like you have certain areas where it

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.080
obviously can get

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.159
stronger so i know you know um lawrence

00:20:08.159 --> 00:20:10.080
mckenna he put a basketball documentary

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:10.640
out which is

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:11.440
actually really good like you should

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.400
check it out if you want obviously

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.760
because basketball is something huge in

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.440
america right in the uk it's quite

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.280
it's it's everyone loves it a lot of

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.280
people enjoy it but it's less

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.880
cared about it's focused on so i think

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.480
it's harder there's less funding you

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.919
know it's harder for teens to grow up a

00:20:23.919 --> 00:20:25.120
place to get good at and stuff so they

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.159
made a documentary just kind of like

00:20:26.159 --> 00:20:26.880
grow

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.480
mba in the uk and that's a similar thing

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.919
where some people might be like

00:20:29.919 --> 00:20:31.360
oh you know nothing about basketball man

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.039
don't you know whereas you never get a

00:20:33.039 --> 00:20:33.679
chance

00:20:33.679 --> 00:20:35.120
yeah it's the same way as like like

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.880
women's football as well or say

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.919
mls or soccer you know it's like you you

00:20:39.919 --> 00:20:41.520
joke about it people joke on it but then

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.240
it never really it can never grow unless

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.080
you have to actually accept yeah

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.520
yeah there's some men's football that's

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.280
worse than women's football for sure

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.720
yeah yeah and obviously like back in the

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:51.760
day like knights football eighties

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.240
football was

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.000
atrocious at times it's just like you

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.080
know you have to get somewhere so

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.600
yes sir hate with me for going to that

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.840
and if you do vic went to the euros

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:00.430
final

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:07.679
[Laughter]

00:21:07.679 --> 00:21:10.400
but we worked out well vic's vic's only

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:10.880

00:21:12.799 --> 00:21:13.919
final yeah

00:21:13.919 --> 00:21:17.360
too fair vic too fair though has played

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.880
in more matches in stadiums than he's

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.039
been to that's gangsta that's gangster

00:21:21.039 --> 00:21:21.760

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.679
yeah right he's played in three stadiums

00:21:23.679 --> 00:21:25.600
or three matches in stadiums

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.039
i'm going to play in the next um

00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:28.960

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.520
put myself into contention

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.440
whether i mean or not okay and when i

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.120
say seven matches it might not be

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.880
i didn't say charity match i started

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.960
football match okay so if you go for a

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.440
want to play kick that well speaking of

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.799
getting fit for a football match yeah

00:21:46.799 --> 00:21:47.840

now i need to be called thunks like thin

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.120

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.080
about that but why has he got

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.919

is he lost weight he's fit what i'm

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.200
saying is getting fitter

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.320
that's a big part of it a lot of people

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.840
just try and get thin by like killing

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.120

restraining from any sort of like fun in

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.799
life whereas he's not the right way so

00:22:34.799 --> 00:22:35.840
yeah and he's been

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.440

who knows why but he didn't miss a

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.679
penalty he did insecurity that could

00:22:47.679 --> 00:22:49.280
have pushed him on so

no i just guys i'm just pressured

00:23:08.799 --> 00:23:11.440
this podcast is sponsored by better help

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.000
online

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.679
therapy yeah obviously life is full of

00:23:13.679 --> 00:23:15.440
stresses it doesn't matter who you are

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.480
or what you have

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.320
your life is probably stressful yeah

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.600
that you can have a lot going for you

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:20.720
you know think you're doing really well

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.559
in one aspect especially with what we do

00:23:22.559 --> 00:23:23.200
we're like

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.200
public facing you know we've been quite

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.559
successful with what we do but

00:23:26.559 --> 00:23:28.480
that's still there can leave you feeling

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.919
awful and you still have days where you

00:23:29.919 --> 00:23:30.720
like you just feel

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:31.919
like crap but then you also have to

00:23:31.919 --> 00:23:33.360
pretend like you're happy to everyone

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:33.760
else

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.679
um so it can be difficult yes you may

00:23:35.679 --> 00:23:37.120
not be feeling down and out and

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.320
depressed or like you

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.880
you're at a total loss uh but if your

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.320
stress is high your temper is shorter

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.000
than usual and even if you're starting

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.360
to feel strain in any of your

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:46.320
relationships

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.919
you could probably use the chance to

00:23:47.919 --> 00:23:49.440
unload especially when it's hot

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.720
when it's hot makes it worse isn't it

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.080
everything's worth it it's not always on

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.279
edge yeah yeah so

00:23:53.279 --> 00:23:54.880
unload the stress and you also can't

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.480
sleep which effects

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:59.279
unload the stress and get it out talk to

00:23:59.279 --> 00:23:59.679
some

00:23:59.679 --> 00:24:01.360
not it though talk to someone who's

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.279
completely unbiased about your life

00:24:03.279 --> 00:24:04.720
someone who isn't going to judge you or

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.240
take sighs on anything when there are

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.600
things that you can't tell anyone or

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:09.279
feel like you can't unload to family or

00:24:09.279 --> 00:24:09.919
friends

00:24:09.919 --> 00:24:11.600
you need to unload it and that's what

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.039
that's what therapy can be

00:24:13.039 --> 00:24:15.200
so better help is customized online

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.799
therapy that offers videos

00:24:16.799 --> 00:24:18.400
phone and even live chat sessions with

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.840
your therapist so you don't have to see

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.279
anyone on camera if you don't want to

00:24:21.279 --> 00:24:22.880
it's much more affordable than in-person

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.320
therapy and you can start communicating

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.360
with your therapist in

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.760
under 48 hours unload the stresses and

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.360

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.880
pretty surprised at what you might gain

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.640

obviously euros was last week yeah

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:10.159
um the biggest topic i would say for

00:25:10.159 --> 00:25:12.960
us not in the world yes that's

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.159
outrageous

00:25:14.159 --> 00:25:16.880
ksi's album launched it's out now it

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.159
came out friday

00:25:18.159 --> 00:25:21.200

bought it yet on itunes still going to

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.799
stream it a lot because

00:25:26.799 --> 00:25:28.880
the charts are and friday so you've as

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:29.679
you're watching this you've still got

00:25:29.679 --> 00:25:30.559
time to make a difference

00:25:30.559 --> 00:25:32.159
and we made a deal with him last time he

00:25:32.159 --> 00:25:33.600
was on that he would come on

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.600
the next time he got a number one and he

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.880
can't even turn it down

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.320
we literally will show him the clip and

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.440
go [ __ ] it's in your flat yeah he'll

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.400
punch us both

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.480
knuckles and he'll sit here and be like

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.919
okay how long do i have to do this for

00:25:45.919 --> 00:25:49.039
but we get views we do get views we get

00:25:49.039 --> 00:25:50.720
ksi and we get views he's been in this

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.279
one since

00:25:51.279 --> 00:25:54.840
the studio i don't think so i really

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.640
like

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.559
considering the meme of me obviously

00:25:58.559 --> 00:26:00.960
like using ksi being

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.320
only being here bro i filmed two videos

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.840
with him this year yeah one was a

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.000
mukbang so i literally just said to him

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.679
i will provide you with food can you

00:26:09.679 --> 00:26:11.200
just talk for 20 minutes yeah and we're

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.320
now in the second half of the year

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.880
and the other one was i bought him a

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.559
very expensive cake to help with the

00:26:16.559 --> 00:26:17.760
album as well that would helped

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.360
yeah yeah and that was all because his

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:20.799
album was being wholesome wholesome

00:26:20.799 --> 00:26:21.600
simon also

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.880
i think we probably would have to get

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.480
him in quite quick because it will be

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.600
much harder to get him to come to a

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:26.559
studio to film

00:26:26.559 --> 00:26:30.159
yeah true than you know here yeah

00:26:30.159 --> 00:26:32.480
but the album came out friday yeah very

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.600
good album

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.520
uh we're gonna run through the album

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.880
quick i'll get it on my phone and

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.360
yeah we're not going to do like a proper

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.720
tier list or anything because

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.240
i think we're both going to do them on

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.760
our own channels so make sure you check

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:44.240
them out

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:47.840
somehow or like listenings

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.000
i don't know yeah yeah yeah and then

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.200
maybe next week or in the future we'll

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.159
then like compare

00:26:52.159 --> 00:26:54.240
each other's tier lists that's an idea

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.159
we had yeah for sure we'll see

00:26:56.159 --> 00:26:59.520
so we have uh one second

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.400
sorry ksi firstly he also overtook six

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.120
nine in

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.240
as big monthly listeners 9.6 million

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.440
yeah

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.840
oh sp before we get into it speaking of

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:10.720
smart

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.360
promotional musicians so you know little

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.080
nars x

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.279
yeah i was going to tell sorry for the

00:27:15.279 --> 00:27:16.640
podcast but i was like wait podcast

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:17.360
content okay

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.799
so you know how he did that thing where

00:27:18.799 --> 00:27:20.240
he reached the devil's shoes or satan's

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.600
shoes yeah and then nike was supposedly

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.399
suing him

00:27:22.399 --> 00:27:23.679
this whole week especially today he's

00:27:23.679 --> 00:27:24.880
been pushing that he's going to court

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:25.919
he's like he's been like i might be in

00:27:25.919 --> 00:27:26.720
jail tonight

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.240
or might be in jail next week and he was

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.679
quite seriously he was doing it very

00:27:29.679 --> 00:27:30.559
very seriously

00:27:30.559 --> 00:27:32.000
putting tweets about like this that

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.440
doing tick tocks saying this that like

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.000
if i was

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.440
in jail um and then uh and then

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.559
it turned out that he put out a video of

00:27:40.559 --> 00:27:40.960
like

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.960
him in court you know he's the lawyer

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.320
he's the uh he's the

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.880
you know always played out music videos

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.399
a trailer someone like a trailer or a

00:27:48.399 --> 00:27:49.760
skit i'd say probably skit's the best

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:50.159
thing

00:27:50.159 --> 00:27:51.840
to promote his new song so it's all just

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.679
to promote his new song but like

00:27:53.679 --> 00:27:55.039
that's very good it was the way it was

00:27:55.039 --> 00:27:56.880
doing was just like done to perfection

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.360
um and it's produced who is it might

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.720
want to google it it's produced by kanye

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.000
west and someone else

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.080
featuring a song yeah yeah i think go to

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.360
his twitter he'll

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.120
if you have the app or twitter.com or

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.720
whatever yeah he'll um

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.960
he's just so smart and i think jj in

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.320
little little decks are quite similar in

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.360
terms of the way they promote things

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.559
because obviously they're both people

00:28:14.559 --> 00:28:15.360
who

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:18.399
um have like garnished an audience oh

00:28:18.399 --> 00:28:19.360
industry baby

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:22.159
coming out july 23rd yeah is it

00:28:22.159 --> 00:28:23.520
featuring

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.020
uh

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:28.960
[Music]

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:32.320
so no oh jack harlow yeah uh

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.440
who is like the man at the moment right

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.640
now doing a lot of big things i think

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.159
it's produced by kanye west

00:28:36.159 --> 00:28:38.480
someone else and kanye west so a big

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:39.520
that's a bigger

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:42.000
big star star cast man and all that just

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:42.880
to promote a song and

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.320
again it reminds me of jj like like

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.120
leveraging you know social media now

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:48.320
yeah back in the day everyone laughed at

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:49.600
jj for being like a youtuber and a

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.880
musician and now

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.799
you know he said he's getting you know

00:28:52.799 --> 00:28:54.000
people are paying him to come on his

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:54.640
songs now

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.840
and paying him to promote them so yeah

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.960
smart what's the feature now they want

00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.760
to feature me

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.919

are one uh

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.440
i can't remember the exact wording but

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.720
it's uh

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.360
how can they cancel when the only thing

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.200
that made me was me

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.919
that lyric i'm like dope there's a bar a

00:29:19.919 --> 00:29:20.559
sick line

00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:23.919
there's a bar and the second one is

00:29:23.919 --> 00:29:26.000
bugsy malones oh that's yeah where he

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.080
goes like you're okay they think you're

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.440
they think you're just a youtuber and

i'm just a grime artist how have they

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:32.799

money we make we're businessmen

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.200

boogie's been one of the you know

00:29:38.399 --> 00:29:39.600
obviously a lot of people support jj but

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.640
boogie's been one that's

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.320
supporting from the start as well before

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.240
like before it was called to be a ksi

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.159
fan or you know ksi collaborator he was

00:29:46.159 --> 00:29:46.880
there then

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.200
so yeah when it was a little bit risky

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.320
for uh

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.120
someone that's cool to co-sign to be on

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:53.760
a ksi

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.360

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.720
boxing him and stuff like that yeah yeah

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.399
yeah it was always it was always very

00:29:58.399 --> 00:29:59.760

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:00.080
sure

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.600
that's so sick and yeah it's just good

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.520
to see uh one line that i do find it

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:04.880
really funny though you've seen the uh

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:08.320
fantano clip so you know if fantano

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.600

fantano he does the is a critic

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.279
you know youtube critic does really well

00:30:13.279 --> 00:30:15.039
um he does like every time an album

00:30:15.039 --> 00:30:16.399
comes out or a project he does a stream

00:30:16.399 --> 00:30:17.919
on twitch that way that listens to it i

00:30:17.919 --> 00:30:19.760

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.520
he does another video that's

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:22.640
actually a breakdown to review it

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:23.679
properly yes that's like his first

00:30:23.679 --> 00:30:25.360
listen then he'll review it properly

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.919
but uh there it goes something like uh

00:30:27.919 --> 00:30:29.520
sorry the tweet goes or the tick tock

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:30.640
girl or something like

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.000
fontana i couldn't even comprehend what

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.679
jj just said um

00:30:33.679 --> 00:30:35.919
in the lyric goes something like uh i'm

00:30:35.919 --> 00:30:37.520
on their head like a beanie i'm sorry

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.200
head like i'm wearing a beanie yeah yeah

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.360
and then he just stops he goes

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:44.240
for ages it's like it's like one of

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.360
those ones where you can't tell if he's

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:45.679
like

00:30:45.679 --> 00:30:48.320
he's a genius or if he's like what did

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:48.960
you just say

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.440
i think you should to be interpreted but

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.960
jj has a lot of free lines doesn't he

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.679
there's one that's like um

00:30:55.679 --> 00:30:58.799
horny like a rhino watching porn it was

00:30:58.799 --> 00:30:59.440
just so

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.679
weird well obviously the one about

00:31:01.679 --> 00:31:03.120
harry's mom obviously which is a good

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.480
line to be fair but it's just very

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.240
you like what what did you just swerve

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.760
though as well yes and swerve yeah just

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:08.880
on the albums on the premium album on

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:09.679
spotify

00:31:09.679 --> 00:31:11.039
yeah but it's still not his song i don't

00:31:11.039 --> 00:31:12.880
think no no it's they didn't look good

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.159
you do a song for me song for you on the

00:31:14.159 --> 00:31:16.159
album type thing but um no it's just

00:31:16.159 --> 00:31:17.519
funny because i remember when we

00:31:17.519 --> 00:31:18.880
did a lot of the old songs with jj that

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.240
new age and also someone just the

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:20.960
simulation like

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.159
you'd be recording right i'm like

00:31:22.159 --> 00:31:23.760
recording listening and he'll say

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:24.880
something i'd just be like

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.519
what the [ __ ] did you say it's just like

00:31:27.519 --> 00:31:29.039
polarizing you know i'm saying like

00:31:29.039 --> 00:31:30.240
which a lot of artists do a lot of what

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:31.519
i just said stupid stuff in their songs

00:31:31.519 --> 00:31:33.200
oh youtube compilation of people saying

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.720
stupid stuff but i have a whole series

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:35.840
based around it rap or crap

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.840
exactly yeah exactly it's probably yours

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.519
thinking of them um so it's just

00:31:39.519 --> 00:31:41.360
it's nice to see because and again it

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.039
just it grabs the attention so whether

00:31:43.039 --> 00:31:44.080
it's a good line or not you're still

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.039
going like

00:31:45.039 --> 00:31:47.919
what did he say what did he say um so

00:31:47.919 --> 00:31:49.120
it's good it just gets people talking

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.640
and that's the best thing you can do

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.880
very true very true now i mean skepta

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.080
has also been yeah

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:56.320
shouting him out which is a very that's

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.080
another cool look big coastline yeah and

00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.600
two fears has always shown support as

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:00.080
well

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.600
oh yeah like we've done loads of

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.279
obviously because of jamie and stuff we

00:32:03.279 --> 00:32:04.640
do a lot of like

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.640

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.000
whatever they do we're always there

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.519
etcetera and stuff like

00:32:09.519 --> 00:32:11.200
short he was actually at the f1

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.880
yesterday yeah and yeah

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.720
uh jamie was somewhere jamie was there

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.320
as well with shawty and bizzle did you

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.760
see him but jamie left

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:19.519
about half an hour 45 minutes after

00:32:19.519 --> 00:32:21.120
something yeah obviously we

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.320
you gotta remember like we just say that

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.519
oh you know shout out boys for

00:32:23.519 --> 00:32:24.640
supporting from the start

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.320
it still was a bit uncool for a lot of

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.320
them to support jj so it's very you know

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.840
it's very viable as well it's a very

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.200
like fair thing to do but

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.480
skepta has always like especially in

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:33.919

00:32:41.679 --> 00:32:42.799
a person yeah

that song is amazing it's actually quite

00:34:42.399 --> 00:34:43.119
good in it like

00:34:43.119 --> 00:34:44.960
it is the beat like the flow just feels

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.960
nice to listen to i mean jj's part is

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.320
very questionable yeah yeah

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.560
yeah yeah but yeah the actual yeah as a

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:51.440
song it's actually

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:55.040
yeah um yes we got the moment first

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:57.119
yeah yeah very good song very i love

00:34:57.119 --> 00:34:59.119
that song am i one of my favorites

00:34:59.119 --> 00:35:00.079
the first time you played it to me as

00:35:00.079 --> 00:35:02.160
well i was like i don't want to be mean

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.160
because i don't mean it in a bad way

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.760
but it isn't it sounds like an intro

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.760
song and yeah it's the intro i was like

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.079
it's a sick intro song because my one of

00:35:10.079 --> 00:35:11.599
my favorite songs on the last album

00:35:11.599 --> 00:35:12.960
was the intro song yeah what she's been

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.640
on right yeah yeah that's like one of my

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:16.000
favorite songs of it i think this one

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:16.560
might be my

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.000
one of my favorites on the whole album

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.119
it's definitely one of my favorites i

00:35:19.119 --> 00:35:20.640
keep singing in my head

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.560
yeah no it's definitely definitely uh i

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.760
don't care

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.160
which is one thing we'll say at the end

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:26.880
of the season

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:29.119
i'll say now but you'll see it at the

00:35:29.119 --> 00:35:32.160
end is his solo songs

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:34.400
are really good yeah which i'm so happy

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.760
about because

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.240
it's so easy for jj to get slated for

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.200
carried by

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.880
uh whatever collabs and it's like

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:44.560
we're at what point is he not like his

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.240
highest chartered song right now

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:49.040
is a solo song holiday yeah yeah yeah

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.320
well it's good actually because

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.680
jade has grown a lot but what i'll say

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:53.440
as well is often

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.560
when you when you're in a situation that

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:55.599
did is now right where he's like he's

00:35:55.599 --> 00:35:56.960
doing really well you've also got a lot

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.800
of like uh

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:01.760
say say not managers just say oh you've

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:02.160
got like

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.359
maybe label people that are like oh you

00:36:03.359 --> 00:36:05.280
should do this whereas as an artist

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.280
especially someone who doesn't have much

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:10.960
charisma or the ability to

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.200
have your own say which changes jj can

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.160
do that by the way he's the best that

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.440
he's best saying i want to do my own

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:15.839
thing

00:36:15.839 --> 00:36:16.960
yeah but other people in the industry

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.640
might you know not have the pilot just

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:18.960
got

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.240
said you know someone might say i'll do

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.200
this do that and they have to do it

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.160
otherwise just gonna get dropped by the

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:24.079
label or locked into a contract whereas

00:36:24.079 --> 00:36:25.839
a lot of jj solo stuff is him being like

00:36:25.839 --> 00:36:27.280
now this is me now this is what i really

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:27.920
want to do

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.440
but at the same time he's like go out of

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:30.720
his comfort zone as well like the

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.079
holiday song wouldn't have been his idea

00:36:32.079 --> 00:36:32.960
he's not going to sit there and be like

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:33.839
i want to make like a

00:36:33.839 --> 00:36:35.119
yeah but somebody's been like you know

00:36:35.119 --> 00:36:36.400
try out you know do this do that you

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.760
know maybe maybe express yourself and

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.599
now it's really paid off so this album

00:36:39.599 --> 00:36:41.760
is definitely both of them combining

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.839
um and the reason him on his own is so

00:36:43.839 --> 00:36:45.440
good is yes people i can't say are you

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:46.960
getting carried by a feature but also

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.359
you start to hear jj as like uh himself

00:36:49.359 --> 00:36:50.400
yeah for sure you know

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.520
with no features because sometimes the

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:52.720
features you pander to their style as

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.000
well if i'm gonna make a song with

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.760
say talia it'd be very different to the

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.000
song that i'll make with jj

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.119
where you when you're on your own it's

00:36:59.119 --> 00:37:01.280
like this is me now so shout out jj

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.520
i have a very i was trying to remember i

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.119
i thought something a minute ago and i

00:37:05.119 --> 00:37:06.000
was like

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.760
that's a really funny not funny point

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.200
but it's a really interesting thing that

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.000
i was going to say

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.599
yeah and then i realized i forgot it

00:37:11.599 --> 00:37:13.119
yeah and now i remembered

00:37:13.119 --> 00:37:16.160
anthony fantano yeah rated jj's last

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:16.640
album

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.839
of four okay so we have our whole yellow

00:37:19.839 --> 00:37:21.520
red card system with sidemen right

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.000
obviously

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.160
you know you get a yellow card for being

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.160
late or missing something et cetera you

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:26.640
get

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.079
two yellow cards you get the red card

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:30.000
and if you get a red card yeah you

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.200
uh lose a video in the grand schemes of

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.320
things you have to do more what

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.520
we've got a wager on the table i'm

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.760
guessing harry just

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:41.280
harry said if anthony fontano gives

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:44.720
a rating above six he'll take the red

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.359
card

00:37:45.359 --> 00:37:47.839
wow so what's jj's stands on what what's

00:37:47.839 --> 00:37:49.390
jj's prediction i don't

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:50.720
[Music]

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.560
i mean based on i watched a bit of the

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.240
live stream

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.800
his his audience is one of the most

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.640
toxic audiences that i've ever seen

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:01.040
and i get that he he is toxic in a sense

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:02.720
like he's like his whole persona is kind

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.280
of toxic

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.960
not in a bad way but more of like you

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.960
know i'm this harsh critic you know

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.640
you know he's got his own his own lane

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:10.640
right yeah i mean i get

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.359
i get you know he breaks it down he

00:38:13.359 --> 00:38:14.640
knows the music

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:15.760
if he doesn't like it he doesn't like it

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.079
that's that's fair enough yeah but to me

00:38:18.079 --> 00:38:21.440
ultimately well to everyone music

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.599
is subjective it's yeah yeah well it's

00:38:23.599 --> 00:38:24.960
subjective but there's still

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.160
you still have the right to critique it

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.240
though no no 100 100

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.240
but that doesn't make your opinion any

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.880
more valid than anyone else's

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:35.839
no but if you're if you are a music

00:38:35.839 --> 00:38:38.240
critique then like

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.720
he's so fanta is more whether whether

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.160
you think he's credible or not that's

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.599
that's the subjective as well but

00:38:43.599 --> 00:38:46.640
he is more versed in music than we are

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:46.960
well

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.400
yeah yeah it turns like compositions and

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.839
times for example structure you know a

00:38:49.839 --> 00:38:51.280
lot more than me about music

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.599
like making a song for example so there

00:38:53.599 --> 00:38:55.119
might be like a

00:38:55.119 --> 00:38:59.119
a kick drum that it happens every

00:38:59.119 --> 00:39:00.880
now and then and it's offbeat yeah and

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.000
you're like i can't listen to that song

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:02.560
it's offbeat

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:05.200
this is awful yeah and i'm like i just

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.200
like this song it just sounds sick

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.640
that doesn't and i'd rate the song you

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.320
know nine out of ten you're like

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.079
oh that out of time it just kind of

00:39:12.079 --> 00:39:14.560
annoys me it's like a five yeah for sure

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:17.760
that doesn't make the opinion

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:18.880
in neither of our opinions no you're

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:20.800
right yeah so cool yeah so

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.040
fantano has a right to give his opinion

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:24.320
and he's probably got a good opinion

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.920
trivia you know if you subscribe to

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.760
his thoughts then go for it but just

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.280
what he said doesn't affect shouldn't

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.359
affect what you should think for

00:39:33.359 --> 00:39:35.200
yourself yeah exactly like i watch a lot

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.640
of reaction videos yeah yeah

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.760
and like subconsciously maybe i

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:42.880
am swayed a bit like uh i don't know

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.000
laid back whatever yeah yeah yeah yeah

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.160
yeah like i'll watch him and

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.839
i might be swayed a little bit

00:39:47.839 --> 00:39:50.640
subconsciously but i try to

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.240
you know i'll listen to a song before i

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.680
watch him yeah normally yeah

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:56.640
because he might go oh this one's trash

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:57.839
and then i'm kind of like i quite like

00:39:57.839 --> 00:39:59.119
that song yeah that's not going to make

00:39:59.119 --> 00:39:59.760
me go

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.920
yeah actually this song's an l yeah

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:03.680
think a song blah blah blah which i feel

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:04.720
like obviously a lot of

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.599
kids who watch reaction videos and stuff

00:40:07.599 --> 00:40:09.200
will actually speak especially fantastic

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.640
people will wait to see what his opinion

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.839
is before they give their opinion

00:40:11.839 --> 00:40:14.319
and i i think that's outrageous

00:40:14.319 --> 00:40:15.520
obviously a lot of them are kids so it's

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:16.640
like whatever like yeah

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:18.240
but yeah he's got a right to his opinion

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:19.920
so has any um uh

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.920
anyone but also you know he can say what

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.200
he wants from the album yeah he has a

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:25.040
right to voices for sure yeah yeah

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:26.319
whereas obviously he would have

00:40:26.319 --> 00:40:27.839
hesitated one but as we just said like

00:40:27.839 --> 00:40:29.359
in context of the song ahead of time

00:40:29.359 --> 00:40:30.880
he's quite funny so like you know we

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:33.599
would score it higher but again you know

00:40:33.599 --> 00:40:35.520
yeah musically you give it one but

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.280
although someone would like to differ

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.960
but we also we are biased with that with

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:41.119
ksi for sure right oh you know 100

00:40:41.119 --> 00:40:44.160
i am 100 bias i will always like

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:47.200
i will always think think of it better

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:48.480
well let's think maybe i don't think of

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.480
it as better but i don't think i would

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:52.400
allow myself to think of it as bad

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.319
yeah so out of the whole album i'm

00:40:54.319 --> 00:40:56.319
looking at it and going like oh

00:40:56.319 --> 00:40:59.760
this song or this song is okay

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.200
and a lot of other people are going that

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.800
song's actually a stinker yeah

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.319
yeah and also we're probably less biased

00:41:04.319 --> 00:41:05.599
to this one because we heard less of it

00:41:05.599 --> 00:41:06.560
like we heard

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.920
quite a bit of it but certain times

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.200
certain songs were surprised you know

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.560
i'm like wow like holiday we all kind of

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.839
heard that for the first time

00:41:11.839 --> 00:41:13.200
it still was before the album but

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.319
everyone's like wow it's kind of you

00:41:14.319 --> 00:41:15.680
know down and especially the

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:17.200
we'll get into it later but um one of

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.480
the tracks that we play is all our

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.520
favorites

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:20.640
we heard for the first time everyone's

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.079
vibing so i think jd wanted that as well

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:22.880
because

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:23.920
again you don't want your friends to

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.200
like be too involved because you want to

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.319
surprise them as well you want to listen

00:41:26.319 --> 00:41:27.200
to it as a fan

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:30.560
yeah um but no it's just yeah it's great

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:31.920
to see him doing well already but

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.520
i did see someone compare it to like uh

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:35.920
was it kendrick lamar's like damn album

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:38.480
and that's pretty bit far isn't it oh as

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.079
in so it was like same level yeah yeah

00:41:40.079 --> 00:41:41.680
yeah well yeah it's it's like i see

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:42.720
people online saying

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:45.200
this is the greatest album ever and i'm

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.160
like okay

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:48.079
again opinion yeah for sure for sure if

00:41:48.079 --> 00:41:49.520
you think it is you think it is

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:52.560
yeah yeah but i think at that point you

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:53.520
might be biased

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:56.240
yeah yeah yeah but it's like people if

00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:57.040
you think that this

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:59.599
album is genuinely terrible and there is

00:41:59.599 --> 00:42:00.560
no musical

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.960
oh yeah concept behind it or it there's

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:03.920
no good sound

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:05.359
yeah then i'm like okay you probably

00:42:05.359 --> 00:42:07.599
just hate ksi yeah exactly yeah so

00:42:07.599 --> 00:42:10.079
yeah it's a bit boss really um but yeah

00:42:10.079 --> 00:42:11.680
the next song number two with future in

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.119
21 savage

00:42:13.119 --> 00:42:15.599
this from every reaction i've watched is

00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:17.200
the most mixed song

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:19.040
is it like there's there's mixed songs

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.240
but this one because

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.640
me personally yeah i think the weakest

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.040
person on the song is 21 savage

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:28.240
other people mainly americans

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:30.800
from what i've watched 21 savage carrot

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.480
uh carried this one wow

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:34.240
and i'm like what do you think of that

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.079
one um i don't i've not really had an

00:42:36.079 --> 00:42:37.839
opinion on who carries it really or who

00:42:37.839 --> 00:42:39.520
like who had the better i guess part of

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:40.480
the track

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.560
again it's hard to do because i've heard

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:43.760
future something i've heard of all i've

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:44.960
heard jj future and international

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.400
so many times that it's like they all

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.400
sound like they would i expect them to

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:48.800
sound

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.640
yeah so no one i just i don't think the

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:51.839
song is the strong one i don't think

00:42:51.839 --> 00:42:53.760
it's the strongest on the album

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:54.880
i wouldn't i say it's probably one of my

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:56.400
least favorite on the album which

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.520
actually i think

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.680
you know it's not it's not a downside on

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:01.119
jj it's more of a downside on

00:43:01.119 --> 00:43:02.560
the potential of that track yeah you hit

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.480
a future 2017 ksi oh my god

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:05.920
it's gonna be incredible but it wasn't

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.920
really whereas you know the first song

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:09.520
at the moment i'm like i prefer that

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:12.480
song yeah a lot of people also said

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.560
straight away look at it that's the song

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:15.760
i want to hear yeah

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.440
at the end of it they were like that's

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.960
one of the only songs i wouldn't

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:21.839
replay constantly yeah yeah um futures

00:43:21.839 --> 00:43:23.040
part though to me

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:29.200
is so good i i

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:31.040
but his part in that i was literally

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:33.119
like i wish this was its own song that's

00:43:33.119 --> 00:43:33.520
what you

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:35.520
yeah that's where you find like the best

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:37.040
or the best for a reason because they

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.160
can go on any track

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:40.880
like again like you know i mean not to

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.720
sound peak on jj but you know

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:43.680
say when future's going to go in the

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:45.839
studio and work with say a drake collab

00:43:45.839 --> 00:43:47.119
you imagine you'd probably put a bit

00:43:47.119 --> 00:43:49.359
more into it than you would say a ksi

00:43:49.359 --> 00:43:50.640
one whereas no future doesn't do that

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:51.119
he's just

00:43:51.119 --> 00:43:52.640
he's future on every song that's what i

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:55.040
noticed about this album though is

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:58.240
i like listening through it

00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:00.160
i don't think there's a single person on

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.000
it that

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.760
sounds out of place or sounds like they

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.040
phoned it in sound

00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:07.839
yeah sounds like they went oh yeah yeah

00:44:07.839 --> 00:44:08.640
just gets money

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:10.319
yeah yeah yeah i think that's right

00:44:10.319 --> 00:44:11.440
that's why they are the best i mean

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:12.720
credit to jd for even getting these

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:13.680
features but

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:16.079
you know again like obviously i imagine

00:44:16.079 --> 00:44:16.720
i imagine i

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:18.079
don't know how it really works i don't

00:44:18.079 --> 00:44:19.680
say too much but future would have been

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:20.880
like someone have been like our future

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:22.480
johnny go on this song or like let's do

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.480
a song he's probably like yeah sure like

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:25.760
he goes for it where's a lot of people

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.760
like oh what ksi i don't want to do that

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:30.000
so i credited them all you know well the

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.040
next one's patience

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:33.839
which we've obviously yeah it's an old

00:44:33.839 --> 00:44:34.640
song

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.160
i think when i do my reaction i'm gonna

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:37.280
i'm gonna do like a i've obviously heard

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.400
the album already i was driving when i

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.520
first heard it but i'm gonna do like a

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:40.319
maybe like a

00:44:40.319 --> 00:44:42.000
listen through probably would skip those

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.680
ones yeah

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:47.040
i didn't listen to on stream yeah um

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.520
and i listened to them but if i was to

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:51.200
listen to the album now

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:52.800
i think i'd skip the ones i've heard a

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.040
lot you're not out of dislike

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.560
just because you're excited to hear the

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:59.119
new stuff yeah i don't want to hear

00:44:59.119 --> 00:45:01.359
like i i hear really love or whatever

00:45:01.359 --> 00:45:02.960
yeah with the radio every single time

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.200
yeah yeah you do every album like if

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:06.560
you've heard a single you skip it

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:07.599
because it's lighter on this album as

00:45:07.599 --> 00:45:09.920
well no okay yeah

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:13.839
i don't is that his song

00:45:13.839 --> 00:45:14.960
well it's probably it's one of those

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:18.000
instances where it's like

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.440
but similarly to like how patience is a

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:21.040
co song as well if that makes sense

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.240
same with like really love so it's kind

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:24.400
of like a you know we're going to get

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.920
together and do this collaboratively a

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:27.359
lot of artists do it these days

00:45:27.359 --> 00:45:28.800
you know you scratch my back i scratch

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.960
yours yeah uh

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:34.640
you is next it's chuckle randolph yeah

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:36.960
john thanks j do you have to do that

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:37.920
which everyone

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:40.480
in my stream said was about me because

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:41.359
the lyrics are

00:45:41.359 --> 00:45:44.480
you i do it all for you yeah this is the

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:45.280
song that was actually going to be

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:46.880
released instead of holiday yeah it was

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:49.119
i think it was a rat call 100 definitely

00:45:49.119 --> 00:45:50.960
right 100 but this one

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:54.319
i listened to on stream and i went yeah

00:45:54.319 --> 00:45:55.680
it's growing like you said in the chat

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:58.000
right good but that's it yeah

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.240
and then it's actually watching people's

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:02.160
reactions to it

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.920
i like every time i heard it more and

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.680
more i was like okay i need to watch

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:06.160
directions

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:07.680
it's a little bit more of a popper and

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:09.359
more of a problem yeah i still think for

00:46:09.359 --> 00:46:10.640
me i like it's probably

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:12.160
i'm not massive the biggest fan of it i

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.599
think like as a song it's really good

00:46:13.599 --> 00:46:14.800
like the song writing but i

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:16.720
kind of it's not my favorite style to

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:17.920
hear jj if that makes sense

00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:21.040
i prefer he's more um it's more rap

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.920
songs and also he's more like rap

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.440
singing songs that make sense so like

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:26.640
the moment you know he's singing in nap

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:27.839
it's more of like a reserve singing

00:46:27.839 --> 00:46:29.359
whereas in you to be fair to me goes

00:46:29.359 --> 00:46:30.160
through it and does well

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.920
yeah but i just that that tone i'm not

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:33.760
the master fan of it um but i think as a

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:34.079
song

00:46:34.079 --> 00:46:35.680
it is a bop but i don't think holiday

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:37.680
was the better choice as a single oh 100

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:39.920
yeah uh don't play really love yeah

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:41.599
they're both good songs both very good

00:46:41.599 --> 00:46:43.440
yeah uh gang gang this is the one that i

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:43.839
like

00:46:43.839 --> 00:46:44.800
everyone was like this is my favorite

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:46.480
one yeah that's my favorite but i do

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.520
like it

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:50.640
that is sick although i actually

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:53.599
i'm gonna have a little little i don't

00:46:53.599 --> 00:46:54.079
know what the

00:46:54.079 --> 00:46:58.079
word is yeah on i listened to it

00:46:58.079 --> 00:47:01.440
firstly jay one's verse is sick yeah

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.760
it's so much better than his own person

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:04.560
yeah yeah

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:06.560
but i listen to that song and you know

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:09.280
at the end dino starts just going like

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:10.560
stop playing

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:12.319
it and starts going off yeah the beat

00:47:12.319 --> 00:47:13.760
changes et cetera

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:15.839
on the stream i'm kind of there like oh

00:47:15.839 --> 00:47:18.800
like whoa i didn't i didn't expect this

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:21.359
listening to it again i'm actually like

00:47:21.359 --> 00:47:22.880
kind of not like that part

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:24.960
it doesn't fit the song yeah the song is

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:27.119
quite fast-paced and it's like

00:47:27.119 --> 00:47:29.200
like yeah i think this song and then

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.800
there's this random extra bit

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:32.960
i think this song for me is like it's a

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:34.240
very good song but it's

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:37.200
also very like it's a very generic uk in

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:38.319
track that makes sense

00:47:38.319 --> 00:47:41.119
yeah it's a very safe uk track and i

00:47:41.119 --> 00:47:42.319
think there's a lot of songs recently in

00:47:42.319 --> 00:47:42.800
the

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.079
current climate in the uk if you're not

00:47:44.079 --> 00:47:45.839
from uk might not know as much but

00:47:45.839 --> 00:47:47.839
it's quite like uh that song's gonna do

00:47:47.839 --> 00:47:49.359
well whereas

00:47:49.359 --> 00:47:50.800
the rest of the album to be fair to jj

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.400
and a lot of the other clever

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:54.000
collaborators as well

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.599
we're outside the box like it's all over

00:47:55.599 --> 00:47:57.040
the place that's the type of album where

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.480
it definitely does definitely just

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:00.079
expand a bit like i think it could even

00:48:00.079 --> 00:48:01.200
could have been very easy for jada to

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:02.800
play it safe on this album completely

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:03.920
and do songs like this

00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:05.280
yeah and it's still been a great album

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:06.960
but it'd been like oh i can't really see

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:09.040
much progression whereas

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:10.880
again good song but i think for me it's

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:12.240
like that it's just a

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.760
good it's a great song but it's just a

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.359
it is just that it's one of them ones

00:48:15.359 --> 00:48:17.280
that you expect to see

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:20.400
on like maybe like grm daily yeah yeah

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:22.240
the video is them in a warehouse with a

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:23.760
couple cars yeah yeah for one shot and

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:24.960
then yeah another shot with some cool

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:25.440
lights

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:29.119
yeah like it's it's very it's very good

00:48:29.119 --> 00:48:30.800
but it is also kind of generic yeah you

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.960
make it like you know it's gonna do well

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:34.480
yeah it's a safe yeah but it is good

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:35.520
though it still looks good it's yeah

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:36.079
it's one of those

00:48:36.079 --> 00:48:37.280
things everyone just listened to i think

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:38.319
swerve is the same as well i think

00:48:38.319 --> 00:48:39.359
swerves another one of those like kind

00:48:39.359 --> 00:48:40.720
of safe songs but i do play this a lot

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:41.440
more than swerve

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:44.880
like yeah yeah yeah oh yeah for sure

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:47.040
uh the next one's rent-free with gracie

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:48.800
i like this i listened to this on stream

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:49.839
and i was like this is the best song in

00:48:49.839 --> 00:48:50.880
the album the worst song

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:53.119
yeah okay but then i listened again

00:48:53.119 --> 00:48:54.319
after and again

00:48:54.319 --> 00:48:56.000
and again i was like yeah i like it it's

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.359
grown on me i thought it

00:48:57.359 --> 00:48:58.800
the reason i didn't like it was because

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.800
the beat and the chorus

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:02.880
i was like you've got this chorus and

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:04.000
then you've got this beat

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.240
yeah yeah i was like what's going on but

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.280
then i've

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:09.119
i've learned to like it a lot yeah i

00:49:09.119 --> 00:49:10.400
like it actually yeah it's really

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:11.280
different well it's one of those ones

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:11.680
really

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:13.200
as well like a lot of the tracks you've

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.800
got jj kind of here and there but this

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:16.319
one you really feel like you get you get

00:49:16.319 --> 00:49:17.520
to know him a bit more like he actually

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:18.000
goes

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.839
you know in depth in the verses which i

00:49:19.839 --> 00:49:21.200
like a lot

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:24.079
then there's madness this song is this

00:49:24.079 --> 00:49:24.720
is [ __ ] v

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:25.680
i don't know if we've ever spoken in the

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:27.359
podcast but he just played his beat to

00:49:27.359 --> 00:49:28.720
us and i was like i think we both like

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:29.680
we've heard this before

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:32.240
yeah and the sample the piano i think it

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:33.839
is i've definitely 100 percent heard it

00:49:33.839 --> 00:49:34.400
before

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.240
i'll say i'm on a splice a lot i'm

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:37.359
looking through samples to make beats

00:49:37.359 --> 00:49:38.800
laughs i'm like i know this sample i've

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.160
either made a beat before

00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:41.599
with that sample or i've heard it from

00:49:41.599 --> 00:49:42.960
somewhere and i know you said the same

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:43.680
as well

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:45.280
it might have just been him playing it

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.839
here a long time ago or maybe when we

00:49:47.839 --> 00:49:49.119
were recording something before

00:49:49.119 --> 00:49:51.040
he played that beat a long time ago and

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:51.760
it just stuck with me but i've

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:52.880
definitely heard it somewhere

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:54.400
and i was not sure if it's somewhere

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:56.079
else or him

00:49:56.079 --> 00:49:57.760
yeah i have no idea but it's a banger

00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:58.400
because that's something i hear

00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:59.520
everything just like through the wall

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:00.640
which is like very muffled

00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:02.640
and i'm like i heard this song so like

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:05.520
every song that played i was like

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:06.960
old versions of like patience remember

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:09.280
that yeah maybe madness as well

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:12.720
yeah um silly

00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:15.359
banger it's the one bugsy oh yeah sorry

00:50:15.359 --> 00:50:15.839
yeah bang

00:50:15.839 --> 00:50:18.319
this song like to go after madness

00:50:18.319 --> 00:50:19.839
madness made me want to just

00:50:19.839 --> 00:50:23.599
like punch a baby

00:50:23.599 --> 00:50:26.400
like i was i was ready to just yeah yeah

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:26.880
yeah

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:30.240
and then silly would be like my victory

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:32.079
walk after punching yeah what's up [ __ ]

00:50:32.079 --> 00:50:33.680

00:50:36.079 --> 00:50:38.000
yeah silly's playing you can't stop me

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.280
my first listen to this car was when i

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:41.280
was driving back from somewhere so like

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:42.800
sometimes song will come on i don't know

00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:44.480

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.079
books have killed us as well bugs killed

00:50:46.079 --> 00:50:48.000

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.200
yeah that's what i mean about people

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:50.880
like their features though yeah he gave

00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:51.440
it

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:54.640
gave us all yeah yeah that song is so

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:55.119
good i

00:50:55.119 --> 00:50:57.839
i wish i had a car just so i could uh my

00:50:57.839 --> 00:50:59.040

00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:04.000
i was like

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.520
obviously we spoke before like maybe

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:06.800

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.559
like it wasn't jj's song

00:51:30.559 --> 00:51:32.079
well yeah i do get that i mean ricky

00:51:32.079 --> 00:51:33.839
look so there's those who don't enrico

00:51:33.839 --> 00:51:35.119
look he's like a big big

00:51:35.119 --> 00:51:36.559
songwriter he's written songs like

00:51:36.559 --> 00:51:38.400
beyonce rihanna

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:39.760
big big big song right like he's pretty

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:40.800
written something like your favorite

00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.640
song if you don't even notice him

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:45.920
yeah i didn't yeah i mean but i i i i

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:46.880
like a song like it's

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:48.720
a very like album filler definitely a

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:50.000
filler but i just like the vibe of

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.119
it it also made me like my hips started

00:51:53.119 --> 00:51:53.599
to move

00:51:53.599 --> 00:51:55.359
oh yeah you know i mean like the song

00:51:55.359 --> 00:51:57.119
played and i was a bit like oh

00:51:57.119 --> 00:52:00.160
yeah yeah i feel this uh then

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:03.200
two songs later no pressure comes on and

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:04.079
my hips start

00:52:04.079 --> 00:52:05.680
hitting each wall i love this song i

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:06.800
didn't think blood pressure was i don't

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:07.680
think i would have i

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:08.720
was i was listening to it like i don't

00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:10.400
think it's my vibe but then day after

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.839
i'm like i'm putting that song on again

00:52:11.839 --> 00:52:14.800
and jade that song is the one that

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:16.079
that's the one that

00:52:16.079 --> 00:52:18.079
made me stop my stream right and

00:52:18.079 --> 00:52:19.599
literally just go like

00:52:19.599 --> 00:52:21.839
i haven't heard this yeah what the [ __ ]

00:52:21.839 --> 00:52:23.520
is it but it's good

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:25.839
yeah because it it's straight away it's

00:52:25.839 --> 00:52:27.200
like you have that

00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:28.720
it's just a completely different sound

00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:30.400
yeah i went

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:32.559
well this isn't ksi a lot of the time

00:52:32.559 --> 00:52:34.240
that we would we were recording

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:35.599
in the past for jj there's times where

00:52:35.599 --> 00:52:37.200
he'd go outside of his comfort zone and

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:38.480
i'd be like oh man like do you want to

00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:40.240
do that because i i'd always be like

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:42.319
you know focus on what you can do best

00:52:42.319 --> 00:52:44.559
but he's like now you know

00:52:44.559 --> 00:52:45.920
push the boundaries and two fade does

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:47.119
that and then in the song he does that

00:52:47.119 --> 00:52:48.720
and it really really works so

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:49.760
it's a credit to him as well for

00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:52.160
actually pushing it um you're looking up

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:53.680

this is songwriting production credits

00:54:34.319 --> 00:54:35.599
nice surprise yeah and he did very very

00:54:35.599 --> 00:54:36.880

00:54:38.079 --> 00:54:38.720
amazing

00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:41.119

00:54:41.119 --> 00:54:42.559

00:54:51.839 --> 00:54:52.319
amazing

00:54:52.319 --> 00:54:53.520
there's a reason this was going viral on

00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:54.799
tick tock when it was like leaked or

00:54:54.799 --> 00:54:55.920
it's a snippet or whatever yeah

00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:57.280
and we all said like you have to make

00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:59.040
this the single like you have to make

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.880
even jayla's like really i'm not even

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:02.799
like the management was like

00:55:02.799 --> 00:55:04.319
yeah we're like no this song is the best

00:55:04.319 --> 00:55:07.520
it's by by far the best so i watched

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:10.000
i think it was dante yeah and then

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.599
there's also a smaller streamer called

00:55:11.599 --> 00:55:15.520
uh wesley who basically they both

00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:17.760

00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:18.559
them

00:55:18.559 --> 00:55:21.599
heard the song and it's like a

00:55:21.599 --> 00:55:24.640
really thing to me

00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:27.839
yeah that bit that literally happened

00:55:27.839 --> 00:55:28.960
and both of them

00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:32.000
yeah this is the song this is the song

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:44.240
i've heard the clip

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:46.079
they were like this was at the outro of

00:55:46.079 --> 00:55:47.680
one of the videos like in the background

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:48.799
i said it sounds amazing

00:55:48.799 --> 00:55:50.880
yeah i'm listening to jj's most played

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.799
songs right over the last like say 28

00:55:52.799 --> 00:55:53.599
days whatever okay

00:55:53.599 --> 00:55:56.880
uh it's just spotify holiday obviously

00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:59.920
patience don't play lighter really love

00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:03.599
and then no time yeah next one is

00:56:03.599 --> 00:56:05.920
number two well swerve but yeah number

00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:06.960
two but swerves like

00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:08.240
someone else's song as well number two

00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:09.760
then yeah in the moment yeah i think

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:10.799
gang gang too fair

00:56:10.799 --> 00:56:12.079
yeah i'm not gonna i had this

00:56:12.079 --> 00:56:13.920
conversation with jj okay yeah

00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:16.160
he was like i said how every streamer

00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:17.440
i've watched who's wretched the album

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:18.079
has said this

00:56:18.079 --> 00:56:19.839
this is the best song did he just didn't

00:56:19.839 --> 00:56:21.200
believe his [ __ ] huh

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:22.960
does he believe us yet yeah he is there

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:24.720
like yeah it's getting the reception

00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:26.000
from everybody yeah yeah like those

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.520
first five songs mentioned they're all

00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:29.200
like charts off in singles that they've

00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:30.240
been out for months so they're going to

00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:31.839
be played that many people but this one

00:56:31.839 --> 00:56:32.960
it's not single and it's like out

00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:34.720
performance so i know little dirk is

00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:35.520
huge

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:37.440
but he's to be phased he's probably

00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:38.559
bigger than a lot of people think

00:56:38.559 --> 00:56:40.720
oh no 100 but it's not because it's not

00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:41.680
he's not the only reason

00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:44.960
he's not because it's now overtaken

00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:47.040
future and 21 savage yeah together yeah

00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:49.119
yeah yeah that's the one everyone wanted

00:56:49.119 --> 00:56:50.000
to

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.640
hear and then this one is so sick man

00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:53.839
and then it's no pressure

00:56:53.839 --> 00:56:55.599
and then the only then it's holiday

00:56:55.599 --> 00:56:57.119
which obviously we've spoken about yeah

00:56:57.119 --> 00:56:58.480
then it's sleeping with the enemy

00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:00.400
which that's a banger as well it was a

00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:02.559
beat on it it's really weird though in

00:57:02.559 --> 00:57:03.520
it

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:06.319
how it goes from like it's like i guess

00:57:06.319 --> 00:57:08.000
well the chorus is big isn't it

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.599
it's what you're trying to say versus

00:57:09.599 --> 00:57:11.760
it's also like the tune

00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:13.520
almost feels like a christmas jingle

00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:15.040
yeah yeah i get how that would be

00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:16.799
that style of being no i like it i like

00:57:16.799 --> 00:57:18.720
it but it's just like the start

00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:21.359
it does sound almost like a because you

00:57:21.359 --> 00:57:22.319
know how he does the

00:57:22.319 --> 00:57:25.440
um i told my mom i was

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:27.280
quitting school yeah yeah she laughed

00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:29.119
and said and he even does the laugh yeah

00:57:29.119 --> 00:57:30.960
and i was like this sounds like a play

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:32.799
yeah okay and then it kind of goes in a

00:57:32.799 --> 00:57:35.040
bit it is the only one i feel like you

00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:36.240
get

00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:39.599
that full story yeah true yeah you get a

00:57:39.599 --> 00:57:41.280
bit about him in other songs but this

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:42.079
one is the one that's

00:57:42.079 --> 00:57:44.000
my heartfelt yeah yeah well i do think

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.440
the second like i saw someone

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:46.640
this was one of the only songs where i

00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:48.400
saw someone's like comment on it before

00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:49.200
it came out

00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:50.480
which obviously affects your opinions

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:52.079
you trying to see any spoilers but

00:57:52.079 --> 00:57:52.799
someone said oh

00:57:52.799 --> 00:57:54.880
the second verse goes so hard but when i

00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:56.000
listen to us actually like i actually

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:56.960
prefer the first half

00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:58.480
the first verse sorry because the first

00:57:58.480 --> 00:57:59.680
part is like very storytelling and the

00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:01.040
second one he goes like a few melodies

00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:02.000
but i'm kind of like

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.480
i enjoyed because the beat is so like um

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:05.839
the beat reminds me of

00:58:05.839 --> 00:58:08.960
you know who's the

00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:10.640
come on give me some so hard you know

00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:14.160
back in the day there's the uh

00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:15.760
give me something bruno mars featured on

00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:17.680
it okay it was like a

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:20.000
yeah it was travis similar to bobby very

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.760
close now okay

00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:24.799
travis mccoy driving mccoy from what jim

00:58:24.799 --> 00:58:26.240
clara yeah jim that's not jim carter

00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:26.559
yeah

00:58:26.559 --> 00:58:28.160
it felt like that kind of type of beat

00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:29.599
like just like like a

00:58:29.599 --> 00:58:31.200
you know that period where it was

00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:32.640
literally there yeah yeah

00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:34.160
that type of song is like a very like

00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:36.400
piano very

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:38.720
crisp beat and you got like sick vocals

00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:40.240
over the top it's kind of like pure rap

00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:44.240
yeah like eminem airplanes playful

00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:45.839
yeah yeah yeah playful rapping and sx

00:58:45.839 --> 00:58:47.359
comes in huge chorus blah blah blah and

00:58:47.359 --> 00:58:48.480
in the second verse i'm like get back

00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:50.240
into that flow again but still got a

00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:50.720
song

00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:53.119
yeah but that's the whole whole album

00:58:53.119 --> 00:58:55.119
yeah um

00:58:55.119 --> 00:58:57.280
i'm just i'm happy it's out yeah same i

00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:59.119
feel like he's he's now obviously very

00:58:59.119 --> 00:59:00.000
busy

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.440
uh but this is like it's

00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:05.040
it's getting less yeah because you know

00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:06.640
obviously you do all the press building

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:07.280
up to it

00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:08.960
you do all the press after it and then

00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:10.400
he'll kind of have a break a bit

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:13.520
yeah um he's like we're not filming

00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:14.960
simon videos for

00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:16.640
two and a half weeks because of the

00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:18.480
press yeah yeah because he was so busy

00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:19.440
that's why

00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:20.880
some people have gone away yeah yeah you

00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:22.880
got breaks yeah so

00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:23.920
he's the only one that doesn't get the

00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:26.319
break because obviously he gets a break

00:59:26.319 --> 00:59:27.920
from simon videos but not

00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:30.160
because he is doing more work yeah i bet

00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:31.119
right now he'd

00:59:31.119 --> 00:59:33.760
wish for a seven video yeah he managed

00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:34.559
to

00:59:34.559 --> 00:59:35.920
like i know there was something the

00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:37.839
other day he had like a bunch of

00:59:37.839 --> 00:59:38.559
interviews

00:59:38.559 --> 00:59:39.599
and then the next day had a bunch of

00:59:39.599 --> 00:59:41.440
interviews and he basically just said

00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:42.480
like

00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:44.400
just try and get these ones in the

00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:46.319
morning get moved this one to the

00:59:46.319 --> 00:59:48.160
night yeah and then he has a day off

00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:49.520
yeah yeah because he was just like i

00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:50.720
just want a day to

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:52.640
not have to do well yeah he's paying off

00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:54.079
that he's working really hard but he's

00:59:54.079 --> 00:59:55.359
reaping the rewards you know that's for

00:59:55.359 --> 00:59:56.720
sure and you know he knows what he needs

00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:58.640
to do to get places so yeah

00:59:58.640 --> 00:59:59.760
don't get me wrong i'm not saying like

00:59:59.760 --> 01:60:01.119
you should feel sorry for it no no not

01:60:01.119 --> 01:60:01.680
at all yeah

01:60:01.680 --> 01:60:03.920
right he's he's doing very well from it

01:60:03.920 --> 01:60:05.920
yeah but when when i say i mean you work

01:60:05.920 --> 01:60:06.799
really hard as well but

01:60:06.799 --> 01:60:08.960
when when we me and sound like oh busy

01:60:08.960 --> 01:60:10.160

01:60:10.160 --> 01:60:12.640
busy week yeah well his is his always

01:60:12.640 --> 01:60:14.160
just he has to go to stuff

01:60:14.160 --> 01:60:15.440
yeah which i think yeah for me

01:60:15.440 --> 01:60:17.119
personally like i find that the most

01:60:17.119 --> 01:60:18.799
tiring thing yeah you could film 12

01:60:18.799 --> 01:60:20.240
you could film like 12 videos in a day

01:60:20.240 --> 01:60:21.520
and after that i've done really well

01:60:21.520 --> 01:60:23.119
today whereas he has to like

01:60:23.119 --> 01:60:24.720
it sounds like a it sounds like i'll get

01:60:24.720 --> 01:60:26.000
over yourself he has to like you know

01:60:26.000 --> 01:60:26.799

01:60:31.760 --> 01:60:33.200

01:60:33.200 --> 01:60:34.880
4 a.m to get the flight you know you

i'm worn out now but at least i can

01:60:36.799 --> 01:60:38.400
relax that's what it's like when you do

01:60:38.400 --> 01:60:40.480
these type of press things but non-stop

01:60:40.480 --> 01:60:43.920
what was it on we were where was it was

01:60:43.920 --> 01:60:45.599
it a sidemen shoot or something

01:60:45.599 --> 01:60:48.000
it was something and he no it was his

01:60:48.000 --> 01:60:49.599
album night

01:60:49.599 --> 01:60:51.440
sorry it was the night the album came

01:60:51.440 --> 01:60:53.599
out yeah i was live streaming

01:60:53.599 --> 01:60:56.480
oh it was like 1 30 and he came in yeah

01:60:56.480 --> 01:60:56.880
just

01:60:56.880 --> 01:61:00.720
he was streaming himself on instagram um

01:61:00.720 --> 01:61:02.720
so obviously he stayed up till like 2

01:61:02.720 --> 01:61:03.920
a.m doing this

01:61:03.920 --> 01:61:05.920
live stream to promote his album and

01:61:05.920 --> 01:61:08.079
then he comes into my stream and i was

01:61:08.079 --> 01:61:09.599
kind of there like i feel bad firstly

01:61:09.599 --> 01:61:10.480
you can't hear the music

01:61:10.480 --> 01:61:12.160
yeah you can't stand there and just

01:61:12.160 --> 01:61:13.599
you'd be bored

01:61:13.599 --> 01:61:16.160
secondly he's getting up at 6am to go

01:61:16.160 --> 01:61:17.280
see lorraine

01:61:17.280 --> 01:61:19.760
yeah mad not because they're dating

01:61:19.760 --> 01:61:21.359
that's a weird rumor you know

01:61:21.359 --> 01:61:22.880
people people think ksi and lorraine are

01:61:22.880 --> 01:61:24.640
dating um

01:61:24.640 --> 01:61:26.240

01:61:26.240 --> 01:61:28.319
lorraine you can meet anyway i'm sure

01:61:28.319 --> 01:61:30.319

01:61:35.280 --> 01:61:36.640
opportunities maybe you can do that

01:61:36.640 --> 01:61:38.000
because you also i don't want to go on

01:61:38.000 --> 01:61:39.359
lorraine

01:61:39.359 --> 01:61:40.960
no yes that's part of it it's part of

01:61:40.960 --> 01:61:42.799
the thing i ain't doing anything

01:61:42.799 --> 01:61:44.640
mainstream like that anything mainstream

01:61:44.640 --> 01:61:46.079

that's

01:61:48.880 --> 01:61:52.160
comfortable because that is like

01:61:52.160 --> 01:61:55.680

oh never mind well you got to do you got

01:61:59.760 --> 01:62:01.039
to step out your comfort zone more then

01:62:01.039 --> 01:62:03.039
to create something worth talking about

01:62:03.039 --> 01:62:04.160
in your mind i i

01:62:04.160 --> 01:62:06.799
think yeah you can talk about yeah but i

01:62:23.039 --> 01:62:24.640

i mean i i do if you wanna go for real

01:62:32.720 --> 01:62:33.920
that i'm not going to turn it down all

01:62:33.920 --> 01:62:34.480
right

01:62:34.480 --> 01:62:37.039
you want to go for a meal with jay-z

01:62:37.039 --> 01:62:38.000
have you met him

01:62:38.000 --> 01:62:40.400
it could be a [ __ ] could be does

01:62:40.400 --> 01:62:42.319
anyone has anyone that you

01:62:42.319 --> 01:62:44.640
know met him but like for me like jay-z

01:62:44.640 --> 01:62:45.359
is obviously like an

01:62:45.359 --> 01:62:47.200
artist business person someone i look up

01:62:47.200 --> 01:62:49.200
to like take a lot of inspiration

01:62:49.200 --> 01:62:51.200
same as lorraine for what though for

01:62:51.200 --> 01:62:53.119
being a [ __ ] legend so surely

01:62:53.119 --> 01:62:54.559
if you love what she does and she's a

01:62:54.559 --> 01:62:56.079
legend because of what you've seen of

01:62:56.079 --> 01:62:56.640
her on show

01:62:56.640 --> 01:62:58.319
on her show sure you want to go on a

01:62:58.319 --> 01:63:00.480
show i'd love to go on a show

01:63:00.480 --> 01:63:04.319
if the downside wasn't

01:63:04.319 --> 01:63:05.760
other people if there wasn't a third

01:63:05.760 --> 01:63:08.640
party that just want to leech and

01:63:08.640 --> 01:63:12.400
drag people down jj is surviving

01:63:12.400 --> 01:63:18.000
yeah jj is different he's very strong

01:63:18.000 --> 01:63:19.839
one of the things he just hates doing is

01:63:19.839 --> 01:63:21.119
like not

01:63:21.119 --> 01:63:22.319
doing what someone else wants him to do

01:63:22.319 --> 01:63:24.559
but i guess yeah that that in a sense

01:63:24.559 --> 01:63:25.760
he's got very he's got his own core

01:63:25.760 --> 01:63:27.920
beliefs right it's very hard to like

01:63:27.920 --> 01:63:29.920
overcome someone overcome that i'm way

01:63:29.920 --> 01:63:30.960
i'm very stubborn

01:63:30.960 --> 01:63:32.640
as i'd say no to a lot of things whereas

01:63:32.640 --> 01:63:34.160
he he does it you know like

01:63:34.160 --> 01:63:36.079
he goes to the shoes he hates it imagine

01:63:36.079 --> 01:63:38.319
here imagine getting at 6 a.m even

01:63:38.319 --> 01:63:39.599
you know love going on the rain but

01:63:39.599 --> 01:63:41.200
imagine going to have to do that then

01:63:41.200 --> 01:63:42.640
this interview then there's a macro in

01:63:42.640 --> 01:63:44.160
your face and that and take a picture

01:63:44.160 --> 01:63:45.280
you know well that's what the main thing

01:63:45.280 --> 01:63:46.480
is that's why it's tiring i know

01:63:46.480 --> 01:63:46.960
obviously

01:63:46.960 --> 01:63:49.119
us saying like oh he travels a bit yeah

01:63:49.119 --> 01:63:50.480
i know everyone's like oh i travel to

01:63:50.480 --> 01:63:51.280
work like i travel

01:63:51.280 --> 01:63:53.200
she's just normal but it's the fact of

01:63:53.200 --> 01:63:54.720
he travels to it

01:63:54.720 --> 01:63:56.640
and then immediately the second he's out

01:63:56.640 --> 01:63:58.160
of the car

01:63:58.160 --> 01:64:00.079
it's you have to be ksi now you have to

01:64:00.079 --> 01:64:01.920
be like oh hey hey blah blah blah you

01:64:01.920 --> 01:64:02.319
can't

01:64:02.319 --> 01:64:04.319
you can't be in a bad mood no like if

01:64:04.319 --> 01:64:05.440
you go to work obviously

01:64:05.440 --> 01:64:06.799
i'm not i'm not trying to compare the

01:64:06.799 --> 01:64:08.400
two but if you go to work you can be in

01:64:08.400 --> 01:64:09.839
a bad mood you get your work done yeah

01:64:09.839 --> 01:64:10.880
just put your head down

01:64:10.880 --> 01:64:13.520
he's literally like everyone is there to

01:64:13.520 --> 01:64:15.359
see what you're about to do yeah and you

01:64:15.359 --> 01:64:16.319
have to be

01:64:16.319 --> 01:64:18.720
perfect yeah because one you know he

01:64:18.720 --> 01:64:20.240
does one bad thing

01:64:20.240 --> 01:64:22.240
we'll move on to the ksi show yeah yeah

01:64:22.240 --> 01:64:23.920
that was a horrible transition but yeah

01:64:23.920 --> 01:64:24.720
well yeah

01:64:24.720 --> 01:64:27.680
and people people just get angry at him

01:64:27.680 --> 01:64:28.079
yeah

01:64:28.079 --> 01:64:30.799
i mean well do you did you watch the ksi

01:64:30.799 --> 01:64:31.520
show

01:64:31.520 --> 01:64:34.000
so i've seen a lot of it but i didn't

01:64:34.000 --> 01:64:35.280
watch it live because i was at

01:64:35.280 --> 01:64:40.880
uh talia's mum's birthday oh banging

01:64:40.880 --> 01:64:42.880
that was a weird weird choice of words

01:64:42.880 --> 01:64:44.240
to throw out there after that

01:64:44.240 --> 01:64:47.839
would it be if titan wasn't so hot

01:64:47.839 --> 01:64:49.359
never would it though that wouldn't have

01:64:49.359 --> 01:64:51.359
real

01:64:51.359 --> 01:64:53.599
it wouldn't really know like if you was

01:64:53.599 --> 01:64:54.880
if you said to me i was at my mom's

01:64:54.880 --> 01:64:56.000
birthday and i was like banging no

01:64:56.000 --> 01:64:57.920
one was gonna find that weird no but

01:64:57.920 --> 01:64:59.039
it's also because you paused

01:64:59.039 --> 01:65:01.039
you went banging well never realized

01:65:01.039 --> 01:65:02.240
that like you know

01:65:02.240 --> 01:65:04.319
anyway um but yeah so i've seen a lot of

01:65:04.319 --> 01:65:05.839
it and obviously we were in it

01:65:05.839 --> 01:65:07.039
yeah just i bought a ticket obviously

01:65:07.039 --> 01:65:08.480
for it now as my brothers at the time we

01:65:08.480 --> 01:65:09.280
were having food

01:65:09.280 --> 01:65:12.480
at like a barbecue and um i was watching

01:65:12.480 --> 01:65:13.520
it and then i was like i saw it beerus

01:65:13.520 --> 01:65:14.720
and that i was like i gotta drive home i

01:65:14.720 --> 01:65:15.839
have to drive home it's like an hour an

01:65:15.839 --> 01:65:16.880
hour drive

01:65:16.880 --> 01:65:18.079
so i was like oh watch it i won't get

01:65:18.079 --> 01:65:20.240
back i like rewind it and like you can't

01:65:20.240 --> 01:65:22.240
no i was like what the [ __ ] i paid for

01:65:22.240 --> 01:65:24.559
this there is a there is a re-showing

01:65:24.559 --> 01:65:25.200
tuesday

01:65:25.200 --> 01:65:27.359
wednesday now yeah it's yesterday and

01:65:27.359 --> 01:65:29.280
either thursday if you bought it or

01:65:29.280 --> 01:65:31.280
you could still buy it as well but no i

01:65:31.280 --> 01:65:34.079
mean

01:65:34.079 --> 01:65:36.000
i think to be fair like i think jd was

01:65:36.000 --> 01:65:37.680
writing he saw his video i think

01:65:37.680 --> 01:65:39.440
did you watch it on your stream today

01:65:39.440 --> 01:65:41.599
yeah yes i think to be fair as well like

01:65:41.599 --> 01:65:44.720
it's a tough one because a lot of the

01:65:44.720 --> 01:65:47.039
criticism and the hate is like

01:65:47.039 --> 01:65:48.400
unwarranted

01:65:48.400 --> 01:65:49.599
but at the same time there are a lot of

01:65:49.599 --> 01:65:51.839
people who have got genuine like

01:65:51.839 --> 01:65:53.280
worries with it and i think he took it

01:65:53.280 --> 01:65:54.400
well and like he's like you know fair

01:65:54.400 --> 01:65:56.000
enough like

01:65:56.000 --> 01:65:58.480
yeah my my two things that i took from

01:65:58.480 --> 01:65:59.440
obviously so i

01:65:59.440 --> 01:66:01.119
i watched his reddit video if you

01:66:01.119 --> 01:66:02.480
haven't seen it it's very funny

01:66:02.480 --> 01:66:04.400
yeah um he basically just goes through

01:66:04.400 --> 01:66:06.559
the reddit of people

01:66:06.559 --> 01:66:08.960
slating the show well that was his read

01:66:08.960 --> 01:66:10.000
it wasn't it wasn't even like

01:66:10.000 --> 01:66:12.559
yeah but all the comments as well were

01:66:12.559 --> 01:66:14.000
i'll watch him not do a reddit video

01:66:14.000 --> 01:66:14.720
this week and

01:66:14.720 --> 01:66:16.240
avoid it and then he'll come back when

01:66:16.240 --> 01:66:18.000
the reddit is different

01:66:18.000 --> 01:66:19.520
and that's what every artist would do

01:66:19.520 --> 01:66:21.440
yeah for sure but obviously jj doesn't

01:66:21.440 --> 01:66:22.319
well damage control in it

01:66:22.319 --> 01:66:23.520
the labels don't reply to this don't

01:66:23.520 --> 01:66:24.640
reply to that yeah it's like no

01:66:24.640 --> 01:66:26.160
criticism when yeah like as you're gonna

01:66:26.160 --> 01:66:27.760
say fair play to him to just

01:66:27.760 --> 01:66:29.520
that's what i mean you gotta give him

01:66:29.520 --> 01:66:31.280
props anyway like even if you hate him

01:66:31.280 --> 01:66:32.400
or hate the show

01:66:32.400 --> 01:66:34.640
yeah you've got to accept he literally

01:66:34.640 --> 01:66:36.640
has reacted to everyone's hate

01:66:36.640 --> 01:66:39.119
and replied yeah he hasn't just gone

01:66:39.119 --> 01:66:40.079
like oh yeah

01:66:40.079 --> 01:66:42.000
[ __ ] you you're stupid he's actually

01:66:42.000 --> 01:66:44.319
like explained everything about you yeah

01:66:44.319 --> 01:66:46.160
well and the two things that i basically

01:66:46.160 --> 01:66:49.839
took from it which i do agree with

01:66:49.839 --> 01:66:52.160
is firstly he said it was 90 minutes

01:66:52.160 --> 01:66:54.079
yeah yeah it was about 70.

01:66:54.079 --> 01:66:55.680
he would have not known that though like

01:66:55.680 --> 01:66:56.720
nah but if you don't know it you

01:66:56.720 --> 01:66:57.520
shouldn't say it

01:66:57.520 --> 01:66:59.839
it's true it's true yeah if you don't

01:66:59.839 --> 01:67:00.640
know how long it is

01:67:00.640 --> 01:67:01.599
you might have been told like it's 90

01:67:01.599 --> 01:67:02.559
minutes and then when it was all i had

01:67:02.559 --> 01:67:04.160
it down it was 70 and like

01:67:04.160 --> 01:67:06.720
true but if you went to a girl and

01:67:06.720 --> 01:67:08.079
you're like oh by the way

01:67:08.079 --> 01:67:10.720
i do have a six inch penis and it was

01:67:10.720 --> 01:67:12.400
like it was like four inches

01:67:12.400 --> 01:67:14.400
yeah and she's like oh that wasn't that

01:67:14.400 --> 01:67:15.920
wasn't really what you said yeah yeah

01:67:15.920 --> 01:67:16.559
you're like

01:67:16.559 --> 01:67:18.079
oh to be fair i actually never measured

01:67:18.079 --> 01:67:19.599
it i just kind of guess

01:67:19.599 --> 01:67:21.200
you're right you're right yeah yeah yeah

01:67:21.200 --> 01:67:22.480
yeah i get you so that was one of the

01:67:22.480 --> 01:67:24.079
issues which in the video he literally

01:67:24.079 --> 01:67:25.520
says that's my bad

01:67:25.520 --> 01:67:29.839
i just got it wrong the other one was

01:67:29.839 --> 01:67:32.160
what was the other one the other one was

01:67:32.160 --> 01:67:34.319
that he oversold it because it was way

01:67:34.319 --> 01:67:35.280
more music

01:67:35.280 --> 01:67:37.359
because he said it will break the

01:67:37.359 --> 01:67:39.119
internet

01:67:39.119 --> 01:67:43.440
i think and ultimately no matter what

01:67:43.440 --> 01:67:45.760
i i struggle to think of many things

01:67:45.760 --> 01:67:48.160
that will break the internet

01:67:48.160 --> 01:67:49.680
yeah i think the only people who have

01:67:49.680 --> 01:67:51.599
like

01:67:51.599 --> 01:67:53.520
yeah it's a hard one too i think like

01:67:53.520 --> 01:67:54.880
what was the king called actually one at

01:67:54.880 --> 01:67:55.440
a time where

01:67:55.440 --> 01:67:56.720
the paper magazine you know she's like i

01:67:56.720 --> 01:67:58.240
had the champagne stuff like that yeah i

01:67:58.240 --> 01:67:59.680
think it was corporate the internet

01:67:59.680 --> 01:68:01.280
yeah that was only because they called

01:68:01.280 --> 01:68:02.480
it really interesting yeah and and it's

01:68:02.480 --> 01:68:03.520
a hard one i think

01:68:03.520 --> 01:68:06.400
logan fighting floyd mayweather is the

01:68:06.400 --> 01:68:08.319
like the crossover of everything

01:68:08.319 --> 01:68:10.799
yes jj got a lot of celebrities in it

01:68:10.799 --> 01:68:13.039
but

01:68:13.039 --> 01:68:14.319
i don't want to i don't want to like

01:68:14.319 --> 01:68:15.680
slate it because firstly i haven't seen

01:68:15.680 --> 01:68:16.640
it secondly

01:68:16.640 --> 01:68:18.080
uh well i would have seen it by the time

01:68:18.080 --> 01:68:20.080
this is out yeah but

01:68:20.080 --> 01:68:23.120
i would have liked

01:68:23.120 --> 01:68:26.799
for it to have been less skit

01:68:26.799 --> 01:68:29.600
and more story yeah because obviously

01:68:29.600 --> 01:68:30.319
it's meant to be

01:68:30.319 --> 01:68:32.560
chaos a story with music and a lot of it

01:68:32.560 --> 01:68:34.239
was mute everyone also said

01:68:34.239 --> 01:68:35.839
i felt like i just watched a musical

01:68:35.839 --> 01:68:37.839
show thing is that again that's it's

01:68:37.839 --> 01:68:38.880
going to be like your own

01:68:38.880 --> 01:68:41.199
subjectiveness or your own your own like

01:68:41.199 --> 01:68:43.199
imagination of what the show is because

01:68:43.199 --> 01:68:45.759
it's called the ksi show right like show

01:68:45.759 --> 01:68:46.640
a show could mean

01:68:46.640 --> 01:68:49.199
tv show or it could mean a musician yeah

01:68:49.199 --> 01:68:50.239
and also like

01:68:50.239 --> 01:68:51.520
it was heavily promoted with artists

01:68:51.520 --> 01:68:52.719
like for the last two week three weeks

01:68:52.719 --> 01:68:54.239
have been promoting like artists in it

01:68:54.239 --> 01:68:55.920
all the way and on the banner of it it's

01:68:55.920 --> 01:68:57.359
literally just artists like

01:68:57.359 --> 01:69:00.000
he did also promote lorraine jonathan

01:69:00.000 --> 01:69:00.400
yeah

01:69:00.400 --> 01:69:03.199
yeah yeah for sure and he also promoted

01:69:03.199 --> 01:69:03.839
it as

01:69:03.839 --> 01:69:07.279
oh it's gonna be my story

01:69:07.279 --> 01:69:10.159
yeah with some music yeah if it promoted

01:69:10.159 --> 01:69:10.719
it as

01:69:10.719 --> 01:69:12.480
the concert it's going to be a musical

01:69:12.480 --> 01:69:14.960
concert with some skits between

01:69:14.960 --> 01:69:16.560
i think people would have gone that's

01:69:16.560 --> 01:69:18.319
what we expected

01:69:18.319 --> 01:69:20.159
i think i think yeah i think one thing i

01:69:20.159 --> 01:69:22.560
do agree with a bit is that like the the

01:69:22.560 --> 01:69:24.400
like the the scriptures parts that at

01:69:24.400 --> 01:69:26.000
times they were quite cringe

01:69:26.000 --> 01:69:29.199
yeah i mean in general is an opinion it

01:69:29.199 --> 01:69:29.759
is yeah

01:69:29.759 --> 01:69:34.000
but he i don't know what it

01:69:34.000 --> 01:69:36.239
i if i mean if i was going to write it

01:69:36.239 --> 01:69:37.759
not write it if i was going to

01:69:37.759 --> 01:69:39.759
direct it myself and i could change so i

01:69:39.759 --> 01:69:42.000
could i obviously know what i know now

01:69:42.000 --> 01:69:45.120
yeah yeah yeah i would have

01:69:45.120 --> 01:69:48.239
made it

01:69:48.239 --> 01:69:50.319
like a conversation with heskey but 10

01:69:50.319 --> 01:69:52.000
minutes of him talking to him

01:69:52.000 --> 01:69:53.839
what happens yeah yeah yeah but i have

01:69:53.839 --> 01:69:55.360
pre-prepared questions which are what

01:69:55.360 --> 01:69:56.239
people want to know

01:69:56.239 --> 01:69:59.040
and it's way more like way more personal

01:69:59.040 --> 01:69:59.440
yeah

01:69:59.440 --> 01:70:01.440
then you have the songs of that era yeah

01:70:01.440 --> 01:70:02.480
then you have him

01:70:02.480 --> 01:70:04.000
talking to i don't know who you would go

01:70:04.000 --> 01:70:06.400
next but maybe

01:70:06.400 --> 01:70:08.400
maybe like someone like sway or someone

01:70:08.400 --> 01:70:09.600
like yeah yeah like you go

01:70:09.600 --> 01:70:11.199
you do the same as you go through his

01:70:11.199 --> 01:70:12.880
time period like this obviously like you

01:70:12.880 --> 01:70:14.239
would end with

01:70:14.239 --> 01:70:16.480
logan but you would then have him and

01:70:16.480 --> 01:70:17.920
logan in the room for 10 minutes what

01:70:17.920 --> 01:70:18.320
happens

01:70:18.320 --> 01:70:21.520
and you just say like oh who won the

01:70:21.520 --> 01:70:22.159
fight

01:70:22.159 --> 01:70:23.440
yeah let them talk yeah yeah yeah yeah

01:70:23.440 --> 01:70:25.520
and if this isn't meant to be funny it's

01:70:25.520 --> 01:70:26.560
not meant to be them kind of

01:70:26.560 --> 01:70:30.320
like oh you know it's literally

01:70:30.320 --> 01:70:31.600
that's the story and then you get some

01:70:31.600 --> 01:70:33.360
of his music yeah or it'll be like that

01:70:33.360 --> 01:70:34.159
it'll be like

01:70:34.159 --> 01:70:36.239
hesky music this person and that's his

01:70:36.239 --> 01:70:37.440
story yeah yeah

01:70:37.440 --> 01:70:39.760
do that or let him write it like because

01:70:39.760 --> 01:70:40.480
i think

01:70:40.480 --> 01:70:42.000
the whole point of ksi and the whole

01:70:42.000 --> 01:70:43.280
reason is even doing well right now

01:70:43.280 --> 01:70:44.239
because again like

01:70:44.239 --> 01:70:47.280
if he wasn't ksi his album would just be

01:70:47.280 --> 01:70:49.040
not no it would it would be less noise

01:70:49.040 --> 01:70:50.800
about it but oh yeah another it's just

01:70:50.800 --> 01:70:51.840
not another album

01:70:51.840 --> 01:70:53.600
because it's ksi people people are like

01:70:53.600 --> 01:70:54.880
so drawn to it and

01:70:54.880 --> 01:70:56.000
i think if you're going to be like you

01:70:56.000 --> 01:70:57.840
know the ksi show is my story then let

01:70:57.840 --> 01:70:59.040
him dictate it because

01:70:59.040 --> 01:71:00.719
throughout his whole whole career that's

01:71:00.719 --> 01:71:02.239
what he's done best is he's you know

01:71:02.239 --> 01:71:03.520
dictated his own career like and that's

01:71:03.520 --> 01:71:04.719
why his immigrant position is in now

01:71:04.719 --> 01:71:06.000
like he's inspired a lot of people

01:71:06.000 --> 01:71:07.120
and showing them you can go from like

01:71:07.120 --> 01:71:08.640
this like the nerdy kid in the bedroom

01:71:08.640 --> 01:71:09.679
to what he's doing now

01:71:09.679 --> 01:71:11.520
but he's done that for himself and no

01:71:11.520 --> 01:71:12.880
one else has like yeah maybe like now

01:71:12.880 --> 01:71:14.159
the labels are helping him get to the

01:71:14.159 --> 01:71:15.199
point you know putting him on this

01:71:15.199 --> 01:71:16.560
getting there getting that opportunity

01:71:16.560 --> 01:71:18.239
that's what they do best but he's still

01:71:18.239 --> 01:71:20.000
been this the whole person getting him

01:71:20.000 --> 01:71:21.679
sort of into those positions i think the

01:71:21.679 --> 01:71:22.640
show would have been you know much

01:71:22.640 --> 01:71:23.679
better if it was like right

01:71:23.679 --> 01:71:25.840
jj what when you can tell it was kind of

01:71:25.840 --> 01:71:26.719
like

01:71:26.719 --> 01:71:28.400
you know it was people's perception of

01:71:28.400 --> 01:71:30.640
jj written rather than his perception of

01:71:30.640 --> 01:71:31.120
himself

01:71:31.120 --> 01:71:32.400
like and you can tell a lot like the

01:71:32.400 --> 01:71:34.000
jokes it's kind of like well that's what

01:71:34.000 --> 01:71:34.800
one of the posts

01:71:34.800 --> 01:71:38.239
in the reddit video is um

01:71:38.239 --> 01:71:40.800
american dad writers calling him a

01:71:40.800 --> 01:71:41.520
fatnik

01:71:41.520 --> 01:71:43.199
for the sixth time i have achieved

01:71:43.199 --> 01:71:46.400
comedy yeah yeah and it's like it did

01:71:46.400 --> 01:71:50.159
from what i've seen it did feel like

01:71:50.159 --> 01:71:53.199
it was a bunch of old suits

01:71:53.199 --> 01:71:54.719
looking at his audience what it was that

01:71:54.719 --> 01:71:56.080
yeah and now you look back on it and

01:71:56.080 --> 01:71:57.600
it's like i think the reason they were

01:71:57.600 --> 01:71:57.920
so

01:71:57.920 --> 01:71:59.760
big on like americans that have written

01:71:59.760 --> 01:72:01.120
this or sorry

01:72:01.120 --> 01:72:02.080
some of the writers from america that

01:72:02.080 --> 01:72:04.000
showed some of the jokes is so that it's

01:72:04.000 --> 01:72:04.719
like a

01:72:04.719 --> 01:72:06.880
cushion to fall on yeah oh look it's

01:72:06.880 --> 01:72:08.159
american that it has to be good

01:72:08.159 --> 01:72:10.400
whereas like i think even if it may have

01:72:10.400 --> 01:72:12.080
been less proper or less

01:72:12.080 --> 01:72:13.520
less you know professionally correct i

01:72:13.520 --> 01:72:14.800
think having jaded dictate that would

01:72:14.800 --> 01:72:15.600
have been so much better

01:72:15.600 --> 01:72:17.840
because you know because i know i know

01:72:17.840 --> 01:72:19.520
obviously the directors of american dad

01:72:19.520 --> 01:72:20.239
or whatever have

01:72:20.239 --> 01:72:22.000
all the writers yeah have written other

01:72:22.000 --> 01:72:23.679
stuff that

01:72:23.679 --> 01:72:26.880
i think anyway is real life but if

01:72:26.880 --> 01:72:30.960
they're known for american dad

01:72:30.960 --> 01:72:32.719
comment like trying to write a comedy

01:72:32.719 --> 01:72:34.320
skit that's

01:72:34.320 --> 01:72:48.960
a cartoon

01:72:48.960 --> 01:72:50.640
the american writers are massive ksi

01:72:50.640 --> 01:72:52.080
fans they might not know they definitely

01:72:52.080 --> 01:72:53.280
don't know a story from the star

01:72:53.280 --> 01:72:55.120
as much as he does or maybe someone else

01:72:55.120 --> 01:72:56.320
closer to him would know

01:72:56.320 --> 01:72:58.800
so they are gonna miss you know and also

01:72:58.800 --> 01:72:59.440
he's got an

01:72:59.440 --> 01:73:00.719
album to write i can't imagine he's

01:73:00.719 --> 01:73:02.719
there with a fine tooth comb going like

01:73:02.719 --> 01:73:03.920
i'll take his butt out take that out

01:73:03.920 --> 01:73:06.400
he's got you know but you know i think

01:73:06.400 --> 01:73:07.920
and that's what i think a lot of the

01:73:07.920 --> 01:73:09.840
criticism was fair i think he's in a

01:73:09.840 --> 01:73:11.360
position now where

01:73:11.360 --> 01:73:12.960
he's ready and his core fan base are a

01:73:12.960 --> 01:73:14.400
big reason to where he's at now like

01:73:14.400 --> 01:73:14.719
yeah

01:73:14.719 --> 01:73:16.080
you know if he gets a number one thing

01:73:16.080 --> 01:73:17.440
he replies to it though exactly yeah

01:73:17.440 --> 01:73:18.320
exactly that's what that's what i'm

01:73:18.320 --> 01:73:18.800
saying yes

01:73:18.800 --> 01:73:20.719
like the fact that you know he even says

01:73:20.719 --> 01:73:21.760
you know maybe i took out on this one

01:73:21.760 --> 01:73:22.080
like

01:73:22.080 --> 01:73:23.440
you have to respect that because you

01:73:23.440 --> 01:73:25.040
know they're the reason why he's in this

01:73:25.040 --> 01:73:25.760
position now

01:73:25.760 --> 01:73:27.679
and you know they've also got a right to

01:73:27.679 --> 01:73:29.040
have that opinion i see a lot of people

01:73:29.040 --> 01:73:29.440
have been like

01:73:29.440 --> 01:73:31.040
don't hate on him for no reason and i'm

01:73:31.040 --> 01:73:32.400
like well a lot of people aren't

01:73:32.400 --> 01:73:33.600
necessarily hating the show

01:73:33.600 --> 01:73:34.960
yeah i mean i've seen people on twitter

01:73:34.960 --> 01:73:36.400
and stuff i've seen people say it's a

01:73:36.400 --> 01:73:38.080
scam and i'm like no no

01:73:38.080 --> 01:73:39.440
you don't understand what a scam is if

01:73:39.440 --> 01:73:41.040
you think that's a scam yeah like your

01:73:41.040 --> 01:73:42.159
scam would have been

01:73:42.159 --> 01:73:43.520
oh everyone buy my shirt it's gonna be

01:73:43.520 --> 01:73:45.280
the best thing in the world yeah

01:73:45.280 --> 01:73:47.040
give me gives your money and just

01:73:47.040 --> 01:73:48.560
doesn't have a show yeah that's when

01:73:48.560 --> 01:73:50.239
it's a scam where half of

01:73:50.239 --> 01:73:51.920
yeah and half of the reddit was like

01:73:51.920 --> 01:73:53.600
just jokes as you would expect even if

01:73:53.600 --> 01:73:55.199
the show was a massive success

01:73:55.199 --> 01:73:56.640
there's still be jokes like our fact

01:73:56.640 --> 01:73:57.920
this fact that you know it's just part

01:73:57.920 --> 01:73:59.440
of reddit it's what reddit is and his

01:73:59.440 --> 01:74:00.239
culture and his

01:74:00.239 --> 01:74:02.000
his audience is but also you can tell a

01:74:02.000 --> 01:74:02.960
lot of people were given actual

01:74:02.960 --> 01:74:04.400
criticism like some people like is what

01:74:04.400 --> 01:74:06.080
i like about it is what i don't like and

01:74:06.080 --> 01:74:08.640
making lists and it was constructive so

01:74:08.640 --> 01:74:09.679
in this day and age as well you can't

01:74:09.679 --> 01:74:10.800
all you can't always assume that

01:74:10.800 --> 01:74:12.159
someone's are trying to cancel him for

01:74:12.159 --> 01:74:12.719
this it

01:74:12.719 --> 01:74:14.640
is just a fair opinion you know and him

01:74:14.640 --> 01:74:16.000
being in his position he has to

01:74:16.000 --> 01:74:17.679
go through his reddit and show the good

01:74:17.679 --> 01:74:19.040
parts but also the bad parts and i think

01:74:19.040 --> 01:74:20.400
he handled it really well

01:74:20.400 --> 01:74:22.080
so credit to him i mean a lot of people

01:74:22.080 --> 01:74:23.440
that

01:74:23.440 --> 01:74:24.640
there were there were a lot of people

01:74:24.640 --> 01:74:26.480
who still loved it yeah for sure because

01:74:26.480 --> 01:74:28.080
i i thought it was great i mean you can

01:74:28.080 --> 01:74:30.080
see the the like

01:74:30.080 --> 01:74:32.400
the budget behind it and the production

01:74:32.400 --> 01:74:33.760
and everything is

01:74:33.760 --> 01:74:35.440
amazing yeah and the musical part

01:74:35.440 --> 01:74:36.719
they're my favorite part the music part

01:74:36.719 --> 01:74:38.960
is my favorite part like i

01:74:38.960 --> 01:74:41.440
i i i've got i think the some parts of

01:74:41.440 --> 01:74:42.800
the acting was a bit cringe but i think

01:74:42.800 --> 01:74:43.360
like

01:74:43.360 --> 01:74:44.960
because of the writing i think it was

01:74:44.960 --> 01:74:46.560
nice how they were in there but i i

01:74:46.560 --> 01:74:47.760
would have probably preferred it if it

01:74:47.760 --> 01:74:49.280
was maybe just a concert

01:74:49.280 --> 01:74:51.600
um but maybe that's my episode as an

01:74:51.600 --> 01:74:54.000
artist i prefer that stuff

01:74:54.000 --> 01:74:56.000
yeah but i think it's just it all just

01:74:56.000 --> 01:74:57.120
depends on how it's sold

01:74:57.120 --> 01:75:00.000
yeah right yeah if it's sold as like if

01:75:00.000 --> 01:75:01.600
it was sold as like an online virtual

01:75:01.600 --> 01:75:02.480
concert

01:75:02.480 --> 01:75:04.239
then yeah yeah and everyone would you

01:75:04.239 --> 01:75:06.080
can't complain if it's just music no

01:75:06.080 --> 01:75:08.320
but i think it's just i think it's just

01:75:08.320 --> 01:75:10.480
basically people

01:75:10.480 --> 01:75:12.400
i mean it's the same as the sidemen show

01:75:12.400 --> 01:75:14.159
yeah was very scripted

01:75:14.159 --> 01:75:17.600
everyone was like i think i like it but

01:75:17.600 --> 01:75:19.120
it's just not that funny well yeah ask

01:75:19.120 --> 01:75:20.640
me if you if what do you prefer

01:75:20.640 --> 01:75:22.320
the the simon show or like a seven

01:75:22.320 --> 01:75:23.360
sunday i'll just say it's happening

01:75:23.360 --> 01:75:24.480
sunday that's what i mean yeah and it

01:75:24.480 --> 01:75:25.679
doesn't take away from the production or

01:75:25.679 --> 01:75:27.120
what the seven show was it's just like

01:75:27.120 --> 01:75:27.600
like

01:75:27.600 --> 01:75:28.800
it's the same way people probably some

01:75:28.800 --> 01:75:30.400
people will prefer to have and react to

01:75:30.400 --> 01:75:31.199
seven sunday

01:75:31.199 --> 01:75:32.400
that's just what they enjoy right it's

01:75:32.400 --> 01:75:33.920
just there to have a content and i think

01:75:33.920 --> 01:75:35.120
that's where a lot of the criticism

01:75:35.120 --> 01:75:35.760
maybe or

01:75:35.760 --> 01:75:36.960
other a lot of the disappointment from

01:75:36.960 --> 01:75:38.719
fans came from is like they're treated

01:75:38.719 --> 01:75:40.080
every sunday

01:75:40.080 --> 01:75:41.520
to like an incredible cyber sunday

01:75:41.520 --> 01:75:43.360
incredible video and then maybe they're

01:75:43.360 --> 01:75:44.159
getting charged like

01:75:44.159 --> 01:75:45.920
15 pounds to see something that's like

01:75:45.920 --> 01:75:48.159
in their opinion shorter and maybe worse

01:75:48.159 --> 01:75:48.960
subjectively

01:75:48.960 --> 01:75:50.239
they're probably like oh well i could

01:75:50.239 --> 01:75:51.520
have just watched you know next week

01:75:51.520 --> 01:75:52.320
side on sunday

01:75:52.320 --> 01:75:53.520
so that's the part of it as well but

01:75:53.520 --> 01:75:55.679
that's not jj's fault that's actually a

01:75:55.679 --> 01:75:57.040
credit to him because he's given so much

01:75:57.040 --> 01:75:58.880
free content for the past

01:75:58.880 --> 01:76:00.320
two and a half well one and a half

01:76:00.320 --> 01:76:02.159
decades you know or maybe

01:76:02.159 --> 01:76:03.600
that's the other thing i feel like

01:76:03.600 --> 01:76:06.080
everyone who's bought it

01:76:06.080 --> 01:76:09.280
is probably a big enough fan of him

01:76:09.280 --> 01:76:10.719
that they've been watching him for years

01:76:10.719 --> 01:76:12.719
yeah and that's why

01:76:12.719 --> 01:76:16.320
kind of i'm not i'm not trying to defend

01:76:16.320 --> 01:76:17.679
him i'm not trying to like kiss his ass

01:76:17.679 --> 01:76:18.560
or anything because

01:76:18.560 --> 01:76:19.840
i saw a lot of people like if i

01:76:19.840 --> 01:76:21.120
basically if we say anything good about

01:76:21.120 --> 01:76:22.159
the show everyone goes oh you're just

01:76:22.159 --> 01:76:22.800
kissing his ass

01:76:22.800 --> 01:76:24.320
well what do you say we all buy it we're

01:76:24.320 --> 01:76:26.239
all we're our basketball yeah

01:76:26.239 --> 01:76:29.840
but ultimately if you just take it now

01:76:29.840 --> 01:76:31.840
as like oh you've paid 18 pounds

01:76:31.840 --> 01:76:34.159
or whatever it was 15 pounds for all his

01:76:34.159 --> 01:76:35.440
content over the years

01:76:35.440 --> 01:76:37.600
still a very good deal yeah it's still a

01:76:37.600 --> 01:76:39.199
very good deal for sure yeah

01:76:39.199 --> 01:76:40.480
you got remember as well i mean like

01:76:40.480 --> 01:76:42.080
what like discord nitro is like 10k a

01:76:42.080 --> 01:76:42.719
month

01:76:42.719 --> 01:76:45.440
yeah would you get like just a funny gif

01:76:45.440 --> 01:76:46.239
i was like you know

01:76:46.239 --> 01:76:47.600
and then also they put a lot of money

01:76:47.600 --> 01:76:49.360
into that i think it was publicly public

01:76:49.360 --> 01:76:50.320
knowledge or they put a lot of money

01:76:50.320 --> 01:76:51.600
into this yeah so like

01:76:51.600 --> 01:76:53.040
you gotta recuperate really and like

01:76:53.040 --> 01:76:54.560
yeah maybe maybe you can look at that

01:76:54.560 --> 01:76:56.080
and think yeah but

01:76:56.080 --> 01:76:57.840
maybe i was it was a bit much for what i

01:76:57.840 --> 01:76:59.199
got but the next time i says you know

01:76:59.199 --> 01:77:00.400
you've also had so much free content

01:77:00.400 --> 01:77:01.679
beyond the years and um

01:77:01.679 --> 01:77:03.120
this is why i asked though in my stream

01:77:03.120 --> 01:77:06.080
i said so

01:77:06.080 --> 01:77:09.120
to everyone who didn't like it would you

01:77:09.120 --> 01:77:12.480
have like everyone that's vocally hating

01:77:12.480 --> 01:77:13.600
it

01:77:13.600 --> 01:77:15.840
would you be vocally hating it if it was

01:77:15.840 --> 01:77:17.199
free

01:77:17.199 --> 01:77:19.199
and all of them said no yeah and i'm

01:77:19.199 --> 01:77:20.960
saying okay well if you wouldn't be

01:77:20.960 --> 01:77:22.320
vocally hating it now

01:77:22.320 --> 01:77:24.719
because it's free then the content can't

01:77:24.719 --> 01:77:25.840
be that bad

01:77:25.840 --> 01:77:27.760
yeah you hate it you're just annoyed the

01:77:27.760 --> 01:77:28.960
fact that you've paid for it

01:77:28.960 --> 01:77:32.000
yeah so be angry at that all you want

01:77:32.000 --> 01:77:34.880
that's fair but don't start saying like

01:77:34.880 --> 01:77:36.719
oh i got scammed because it was

01:77:36.719 --> 01:77:38.880
[ __ ] blah blah blah there was that one

01:77:38.880 --> 01:77:40.159
funny comment in his video where they

01:77:40.159 --> 01:77:41.679
were like um i didn't even pay for this

01:77:41.679 --> 01:77:43.280
enough but still feel scared

01:77:43.280 --> 01:77:45.040
yeah that's just banner isn't it yeah

01:77:45.040 --> 01:77:46.400
yeah it's the same way it's like you

01:77:46.400 --> 01:77:46.640
know

01:77:46.640 --> 01:77:47.760
currently under his tweets and people

01:77:47.760 --> 01:77:49.040
just copy and paste stuff and they're

01:77:49.040 --> 01:77:49.679
just doing it for

01:77:49.679 --> 01:77:51.360
for tweets for attention yeah they don't

01:77:51.360 --> 01:77:52.719
actually mean it but um

01:77:52.719 --> 01:77:54.560
yeah i think in general i think it's

01:77:54.560 --> 01:77:56.800
like like he said in his videos well

01:77:56.800 --> 01:77:58.320
it's not even an l really for me it's

01:77:58.320 --> 01:77:59.840
like it's just maybe not so much it's

01:77:59.840 --> 01:78:00.400
not a

01:78:00.400 --> 01:78:03.120
it's not so much it's not an l as much

01:78:03.120 --> 01:78:04.400
as it's like a weak w

01:78:04.400 --> 01:78:05.679
like it's still the whole point of it is

01:78:05.679 --> 01:78:06.800
still to promote this album and it has

01:78:06.800 --> 01:78:07.840
done that like

01:78:07.840 --> 01:78:09.600
yeah like i hate the show it still would

01:78:09.600 --> 01:78:11.760
have you know massively benefited the

01:78:11.760 --> 01:78:13.120
promotion of his albums so he's what it

01:78:13.120 --> 01:78:13.440
is

01:78:13.440 --> 01:78:15.840
which didn't live up to i think his

01:78:15.840 --> 01:78:17.760
standard standard yeah yeah

01:78:17.760 --> 01:78:20.239
but it was the same way simon sunday we

01:78:20.239 --> 01:78:21.600
had logan paul in it yeah

01:78:21.600 --> 01:78:24.480
fishing with him uh the last couple

01:78:24.480 --> 01:78:25.120
weeks

01:78:25.120 --> 01:78:28.400
every no one has said

01:78:28.400 --> 01:78:30.480
we are doing a sidemen sunday with logan

01:78:30.480 --> 01:78:32.719
paul logan has said

01:78:32.719 --> 01:78:34.239
uh oh yeah we're linking up with a

01:78:34.239 --> 01:78:35.760
sidemen or something like that no so

01:78:35.760 --> 01:78:38.800
yeah keemstar said logan is in london

01:78:38.800 --> 01:78:41.520
filming a sidemen video no one ever told

01:78:41.520 --> 01:78:42.800
him this he just

01:78:42.800 --> 01:78:46.320
assumed yeah so my whole point is here

01:78:46.320 --> 01:78:49.040
that everyone was angry for the last two

01:78:49.040 --> 01:78:50.560
three weeks whatever since he came to

01:78:50.560 --> 01:78:52.000
london and we've posted

01:78:52.000 --> 01:78:54.239
every week where's logan why isn't logan

01:78:54.239 --> 01:78:55.760
here blah blah blah

01:78:55.760 --> 01:78:57.120
no one's ever said it you've made the

01:78:57.120 --> 01:78:59.199
assumption yourself and now

01:78:59.199 --> 01:79:01.040
got angry at something which yeah you've

01:79:01.040 --> 01:79:03.600
created yourself a smart assumption

01:79:03.600 --> 01:79:05.760
oh yeah but as in like no no yeah you

01:79:05.760 --> 01:79:06.960
can't be angry at something that you've

01:79:06.960 --> 01:79:08.320
made up like if i go

01:79:08.320 --> 01:79:11.360
ah randolph

01:79:11.360 --> 01:79:14.560
he farted on my pillow yesterday but i

01:79:14.560 --> 01:79:15.280
made that up

01:79:15.280 --> 01:79:17.040
it comes i can't be angry because i've

01:79:17.040 --> 01:79:18.400
just made it when like

01:79:18.400 --> 01:79:20.800
you know uh i've done something bad to

01:79:20.800 --> 01:79:21.600
laura in a dream

01:79:21.600 --> 01:79:23.040
she's not what the [ __ ] yeah it's a

01:79:23.040 --> 01:79:24.800
dream yeah so your own interpretation of

01:79:24.800 --> 01:79:26.640
your mind it's like you have made this

01:79:26.640 --> 01:79:28.560
yeah assumption up and then got angry

01:79:28.560 --> 01:79:30.239
because it hasn't but

01:79:30.239 --> 01:79:31.679
your expectations one thing regarding

01:79:31.679 --> 01:79:33.120
the logan paul thing is that he was

01:79:33.120 --> 01:79:34.239
never ever

01:79:34.239 --> 01:79:35.360
the whole point of him being in the show

01:79:35.360 --> 01:79:37.280
was meant to be a surprise to jj

01:79:37.280 --> 01:79:40.560
yeah but he said on a live stream um

01:79:40.560 --> 01:79:42.960
i um so mom's originally messaged me to

01:79:42.960 --> 01:79:44.080
like he's like can you please

01:79:44.080 --> 01:79:45.199
send them to us can you give logan a

01:79:45.199 --> 01:79:47.360
call and actually like put this together

01:79:47.360 --> 01:79:48.960
because he didn't do that oh yeah he

01:79:48.960 --> 01:79:50.000
didn't want to reach out and obviously

01:79:50.000 --> 01:79:50.800
because of the pokemon stuff he was like

01:79:50.800 --> 01:79:52.320
maybe he you know so i mentioned logan i

01:79:52.320 --> 01:79:52.960
was like

01:79:52.960 --> 01:79:54.239
he ain't gonna like he's just gonna

01:79:54.239 --> 01:79:55.679
ignore me but to be fair he actually

01:79:55.679 --> 01:79:57.120
i've messaged him saying you know jj's

01:79:57.120 --> 01:79:58.159
manager got something big

01:79:58.159 --> 01:79:59.440
you want to be involved and he said yes

01:79:59.440 --> 01:80:01.199
i'd pass the number to mums and then

01:80:01.199 --> 01:80:02.800
and then i was like basically saying no

01:80:02.800 --> 01:80:04.239
still and then you said yeah

01:80:04.239 --> 01:80:06.080
um so yeah credit to logan for even

01:80:06.080 --> 01:80:07.360
doing it in the first place but though

01:80:07.360 --> 01:80:08.560
he was supposed to be completely pro

01:80:08.560 --> 01:80:08.800
it's

01:80:08.800 --> 01:80:10.400
meant to be a surprise to jj yeah the

01:80:10.400 --> 01:80:11.440
whole point was that he's gonna be in

01:80:11.440 --> 01:80:12.880
the show and surprised jj and jj is

01:80:12.880 --> 01:80:14.080
gonna be like what the hell is it

01:80:14.080 --> 01:80:17.600
that doesn't make sense though because

01:80:17.600 --> 01:80:19.760
where in the show what logan's going to

01:80:19.760 --> 01:80:20.880
reveal himself you

01:80:20.880 --> 01:80:23.040
think of think of the production on that

01:80:23.040 --> 01:80:24.560
you're saying that logan is going to be

01:80:24.560 --> 01:80:24.960
there

01:80:24.960 --> 01:80:26.960
and film with jj and then pull his hood

01:80:26.960 --> 01:80:28.639
down and jj's going to genuinely be

01:80:28.639 --> 01:80:30.239
shocked if they if it was one take it

01:80:30.239 --> 01:80:31.120
would have worked

01:80:31.120 --> 01:80:32.480
yeah but i was there when you did your

01:80:32.480 --> 01:80:34.560
the the seven part it wasn't one take

01:80:34.560 --> 01:80:36.800
no thirty five takes i think we showed

01:80:36.800 --> 01:80:38.000
you in the bloopers where he like throws

01:80:38.000 --> 01:80:38.239
the

01:80:38.239 --> 01:80:40.800
sushi everywhere but yeah but i think in

01:80:40.800 --> 01:80:41.920
general it's just gonna be like a nasty

01:80:41.920 --> 01:80:43.199
prize for jj but then logan in the live

01:80:43.199 --> 01:80:44.400
stream was like

01:80:44.400 --> 01:80:46.159
i might have done the work says with ksi

01:80:46.159 --> 01:80:47.920
out of the simon and then that's when

01:80:47.920 --> 01:80:49.679
jj asked ma'am just like why she said

01:80:49.679 --> 01:80:50.719
this and obviously mum's that point has

01:80:50.719 --> 01:80:51.679
to be like well this is what happens

01:80:51.679 --> 01:80:52.239
what's happening

01:80:52.239 --> 01:80:54.560
well the other thing about the ksi show

01:80:54.560 --> 01:80:55.920
even if you hate it

01:80:55.920 --> 01:80:58.560
um the only reason we've now collabed

01:80:58.560 --> 01:81:00.400
with logan paul is because of that yeah

01:81:00.400 --> 01:81:01.280
logan came over

01:81:01.280 --> 01:81:04.239
specifically for the ksi show and then

01:81:04.239 --> 01:81:04.560
we

01:81:04.560 --> 01:81:06.159
we had already planned that weekend we

01:81:06.159 --> 01:81:08.480
were like oh we're gonna decide sunday

01:81:08.480 --> 01:81:10.480
we're just gonna go fishing we were like

01:81:10.480 --> 01:81:13.280
people asked us to funny video sure

01:81:13.280 --> 01:81:14.560
let's do it

01:81:14.560 --> 01:81:18.480
did that um had the ksi show and we

01:81:18.480 --> 01:81:21.120
we went it's a real shame logan is

01:81:21.120 --> 01:81:22.480
coming all the way to london we're not

01:81:22.480 --> 01:81:24.159
doing simon sunday with him that is such

01:81:24.159 --> 01:81:24.639
a

01:81:24.639 --> 01:81:27.520
waste yeah yeah so we went what have we

01:81:27.520 --> 01:81:28.159
got

01:81:28.159 --> 01:81:29.920
especially being involved with ksi as

01:81:29.920 --> 01:81:31.040
well like if you obviously if you just

01:81:31.040 --> 01:81:32.400
came to london for like something else

01:81:32.400 --> 01:81:33.280
it's gonna be different because he's

01:81:33.280 --> 01:81:34.960
actually being involved with one of the

01:81:34.960 --> 01:81:36.480
members of the side man then you know

01:81:36.480 --> 01:81:38.560
yeah exactly so we we were there like

01:81:38.560 --> 01:81:41.840
what we got we got fishing [ __ ] it

01:81:41.840 --> 01:81:43.120
should we just invite logan paul

01:81:43.120 --> 01:81:45.679
to go fishing with us ethan texted him

01:81:45.679 --> 01:81:46.239
and

01:81:46.239 --> 01:81:48.239
uh he's like oh hey man no you're in

01:81:48.239 --> 01:81:49.760
london obviously if you're busy whatever

01:81:49.760 --> 01:81:50.800
that's calm

01:81:50.800 --> 01:81:52.320
uh we're doing assignment sunday we're

01:81:52.320 --> 01:81:54.800

01:81:54.800 --> 01:81:58.080
as [ __ ] yeah nice yeah and we're like

01:81:58.080 --> 01:81:59.600
wait what we didn't expect him to reply

01:81:59.600 --> 01:82:00.639
it just worked there you got him like

01:82:00.639 --> 01:82:01.520
logos from uh

01:82:01.520 --> 01:82:04.000
higher rise like you know i'm sure he

01:82:04.000 --> 01:82:04.719
was lost fishing

01:82:04.719 --> 01:82:07.360
he does we were very like he probably

01:82:07.360 --> 01:82:08.000
won't reply

01:82:08.000 --> 01:82:09.360
okay ethan wasn't even sure if it was

01:82:09.360 --> 01:82:10.800
the right number still all right okay

01:82:10.800 --> 01:82:11.600
you never know how

01:82:11.600 --> 01:82:12.960
often people change number or whatever

01:82:12.960 --> 01:82:14.639
yeah well i probably won't reply then he

01:82:14.639 --> 01:82:16.320
says he replies he says that

01:82:16.320 --> 01:82:17.920
we're like what the what the hell we're

01:82:17.920 --> 01:82:19.440
actually gonna do this video

01:82:19.440 --> 01:82:22.719
then i was i was very like

01:82:22.719 --> 01:82:25.760
i will believe it when i see he he might

01:82:25.760 --> 01:82:26.560
not turn it up

01:82:26.560 --> 01:82:28.880
i think it's very he hasn't asked much

01:82:28.880 --> 01:82:30.480
about details you know tanya

01:82:30.480 --> 01:82:32.880
our like manager basically or like

01:82:32.880 --> 01:82:34.400
personal manager kind of thing started

01:82:34.400 --> 01:82:37.120
organizing it with their team yeah yeah

01:82:37.120 --> 01:82:38.880
we were kind of like okay

01:82:38.880 --> 01:82:40.639
we'll wait and see that they turn up

01:82:40.639 --> 01:82:42.000
just because

01:82:42.000 --> 01:82:44.000
they're hella busy jet lagged they're

01:82:44.000 --> 01:82:45.440
doing the ksi show for a day or two

01:82:45.440 --> 01:82:46.880
whatever yeah they're leaving literally

01:82:46.880 --> 01:82:47.520
the morning

01:82:47.520 --> 01:82:49.760
after it they might just wake up and be

01:82:49.760 --> 01:82:51.760
like sorry dad's like

01:82:51.760 --> 01:82:53.440
yeah which is fair i wouldn't blame him

01:82:53.440 --> 01:82:54.480
yeah but you gotta remember like you are

01:82:54.480 --> 01:82:55.679
the cyberman and

01:82:55.679 --> 01:82:57.520
he is ksi like yeah yeah but he's done

01:82:57.520 --> 01:82:59.360
the ksi part and he's probably a slight

01:82:59.360 --> 01:83:00.000
shot he went

01:83:00.000 --> 01:83:01.840
i'm not saying he would bail on that i'm

01:83:01.840 --> 01:83:03.920
just saying like the sidemen part was

01:83:03.920 --> 01:83:04.639
very like

01:83:04.639 --> 01:83:06.880
lackluster do you want to go fishing

01:83:06.880 --> 01:83:08.560
forever imagine in america right imagine

01:83:08.560 --> 01:83:09.520
you go to la

01:83:09.520 --> 01:83:11.440
um and oh i guess well now puerto rico

01:83:11.440 --> 01:83:13.440
was taken in l.a right and you're like

01:83:13.440 --> 01:83:15.360
oh man you're just filming going there

01:83:15.360 --> 01:83:17.199
for film you're in there for a reason

01:83:17.199 --> 01:83:18.239
not just a holiday

01:83:18.239 --> 01:83:19.760
and logan paul texture is like you want

01:83:19.760 --> 01:83:21.920
to come go quiet you can like yeah

01:83:21.920 --> 01:83:23.440
like yeah but he sees you the same way

01:83:23.440 --> 01:83:25.440
you see him like it's just now but

01:83:25.440 --> 01:83:27.600
i that's the thing i don't see that

01:83:27.600 --> 01:83:29.120
because i think

01:83:29.120 --> 01:83:31.840
like for me even being on his go-karting

01:83:31.840 --> 01:83:32.800
video

01:83:32.800 --> 01:83:35.920
is a way bigger opportunity for me than

01:83:35.920 --> 01:83:37.120
him being an assignment but in your

01:83:37.120 --> 01:83:38.320
opinion he might see it differently he

01:83:38.320 --> 01:83:39.520
might think oh man like you can't

01:83:39.520 --> 01:83:40.239
remember like

01:83:40.239 --> 01:83:41.520
so it's logan paul yeah one of one of

01:83:41.520 --> 01:83:42.639
the biggest people you know stars in the

01:83:42.639 --> 01:83:43.520
world but so

01:83:43.520 --> 01:83:45.760
sad men are all that as well and so jj

01:83:45.760 --> 01:83:46.880
so he's like he might be you know

01:83:46.880 --> 01:83:48.000
not only is he thinking now that we

01:83:48.000 --> 01:83:49.920
might not be fun to go you know fishing

01:83:49.920 --> 01:83:51.040
with you lot

01:83:51.040 --> 01:83:52.480
you know it's also like oh man it's a

01:83:52.480 --> 01:83:54.159
good opportunity for me which it is

01:83:54.159 --> 01:83:55.360
look at the comments look at everyone

01:83:55.360 --> 01:83:57.280
logan's so chill now logan you know

01:83:57.280 --> 01:83:58.800
what a great guy is it's good business

01:83:58.800 --> 01:84:00.719
choice him as well he would want to do

01:84:00.719 --> 01:84:01.280
it anyway

01:84:01.280 --> 01:84:03.120
because he's a cool guy but also like

01:84:03.120 --> 01:84:04.560
it's smart for him as well

01:84:04.560 --> 01:84:07.040
makes sense he was actually obviously as

01:84:07.040 --> 01:84:08.719
i said before i'd met him for

01:84:08.719 --> 01:84:10.480
nine seconds after one of the fights

01:84:10.480 --> 01:84:12.320
yeah and he just said hi

01:84:12.320 --> 01:84:14.840
he's actually a very very nice guy he is

01:84:14.840 --> 01:84:16.719
um and

01:84:16.719 --> 01:84:18.880
yeah i think he i i'm not gonna lie i

01:84:18.880 --> 01:84:20.239
think he was very disappointed with the

01:84:20.239 --> 01:84:21.040
fishing

01:84:21.040 --> 01:84:22.800
because he said like oh yeah i go

01:84:22.800 --> 01:84:24.159
fishing quite a bit yeah he was quite

01:84:24.159 --> 01:84:25.600
excited and he was like yeah we normally

01:84:25.600 --> 01:84:26.639
you know

01:84:26.639 --> 01:84:29.040
we're catching big ass fish american

01:84:29.040 --> 01:84:30.080
fish yeah yeah

01:84:30.080 --> 01:84:31.840
whereas here we were catching like

01:84:31.840 --> 01:84:33.840
little baby sharks

01:84:33.840 --> 01:84:36.960
like stinky little stingray and a little

01:84:36.960 --> 01:84:38.639
starfish

01:84:38.639 --> 01:84:42.080
and a bag and a bag come back

01:84:42.080 --> 01:84:44.320
but the video guess where it is out of

01:84:44.320 --> 01:84:45.840
ten one

01:84:45.840 --> 01:84:47.679
shock well i saw you can ask me those

01:84:47.679 --> 01:84:49.120
numbers yeah

01:84:49.120 --> 01:84:50.400
so i'll give you context what i've seen

01:84:50.400 --> 01:84:53.440
so far so i've seen the sidemen tweet

01:84:53.440 --> 01:84:56.800
of it being like four million views or

01:84:56.800 --> 01:84:59.600
six million views in like four hours

01:84:59.600 --> 01:85:02.080
what was it sorry something like that

01:85:02.080 --> 01:85:03.440
but right well i'll tell you right now

01:85:03.440 --> 01:85:04.960
it's been out for one day

01:85:04.960 --> 01:85:08.080
three hours so 27 hours

01:85:08.080 --> 01:85:11.199
number two is the

01:85:11.199 --> 01:85:14.560
holiday video 5.9 extreme cook-off is

01:85:14.560 --> 01:85:15.679
also on 5.9

01:85:15.679 --> 01:85:16.639
which is funny because that one

01:85:16.639 --> 01:85:19.280
supposedly got those hey yeah

01:85:19.280 --> 01:85:22.560
this is on 7.9

01:85:22.560 --> 01:85:25.040
so basically 8 million views in just

01:85:25.040 --> 01:85:26.080
over a day

01:85:26.080 --> 01:85:30.000
that is disgusting here's disgusting

01:85:30.000 --> 01:85:33.199
that is disgusting

01:85:33.199 --> 01:85:36.239
it's actually that's

01:85:36.239 --> 01:85:37.360
unbelievable i was gonna make a joke

01:85:37.360 --> 01:85:38.880
earlier on the podcast that um as i

01:85:38.880 --> 01:85:40.719
asked r7 can i join the sidemen

01:85:40.719 --> 01:85:44.080

01:85:44.080 --> 01:85:45.840
i wish i was so i could afford some good

01:85:45.840 --> 01:85:47.440
air conditioning that was gonna be my

01:85:47.440 --> 01:85:49.280
joke

01:85:49.280 --> 01:85:51.360
it wasn't great wasn't it no that's why

01:85:51.360 --> 01:85:52.480
i had no relevance to

01:85:52.480 --> 01:85:54.480
absolutely anything i just think you

01:85:54.480 --> 01:85:56.080
know i'm always here i was like um

01:85:56.080 --> 01:85:56.880
what's the funny thing to open the

01:85:56.880 --> 01:85:58.080
podcast with and that wasn't what i was

01:85:58.080 --> 01:85:59.120
gonna go with but

01:85:59.120 --> 01:86:00.800
it didn't explain that you don't have

01:86:00.800 --> 01:86:02.159
air conditioning you didn't explain oh

01:86:02.159 --> 01:86:02.480
yeah

01:86:02.480 --> 01:86:03.600
i don't i don't have air conditioning

01:86:03.600 --> 01:86:04.960
it's been hot it's been hot it's been

01:86:04.960 --> 01:86:06.159
hard in the uk

01:86:06.159 --> 01:86:08.719
yeah i'm i'm agreeing that i wasn't the

01:86:08.719 --> 01:86:10.800
joker i went with i didn't go with it

01:86:10.800 --> 01:86:12.000
i'm just saying you know that's what

01:86:12.000 --> 01:86:12.400
wasn't

01:86:12.400 --> 01:86:14.000
one of my jokes so the reason i was

01:86:14.000 --> 01:86:15.199
looking at the distance i was gonna try

01:86:15.199 --> 01:86:16.400
and fit into that i was like i wish i

01:86:16.400 --> 01:86:17.440
had eight million views

01:86:17.440 --> 01:86:20.400
imagine if you paid 18 pounds for that

01:86:20.400 --> 01:86:22.239
18 months for that i would complain

01:86:22.239 --> 01:86:24.400
yeah you know you know here's what it is

01:86:24.400 --> 01:86:26.000
though i don't know what else we have to

01:86:26.000 --> 01:86:27.360
talk about

01:86:27.360 --> 01:86:30.239
what else has happened yeah what's good

01:86:30.239 --> 01:86:31.280
questions

01:86:31.280 --> 01:86:32.719
you want uh we can leave them we'll

01:86:32.719 --> 01:86:34.800
leave them for a guess yeah um

01:86:34.800 --> 01:86:36.080
what else has happened you don't watch

01:86:36.080 --> 01:86:37.920
love island which is a bit sad

01:86:37.920 --> 01:86:40.480
no it's not it is it's it's it's it's

01:86:40.480 --> 01:86:42.080
not that you watch it it's a cultural

01:86:42.080 --> 01:86:42.800
thing

01:86:42.800 --> 01:86:44.400
i don't watch it because i'm there like

01:86:44.400 --> 01:86:46.320
oh i can't wait to see who they pick

01:86:46.320 --> 01:86:48.159
no but we used to be like that i used to

01:86:48.159 --> 01:86:49.920
be like that i'm allowed to say it's

01:86:49.920 --> 01:86:50.880
fallen off

01:86:50.880 --> 01:86:52.880
oh it has fallen off yeah but there's

01:86:52.880 --> 01:86:53.920
still moments

01:86:53.920 --> 01:86:55.679
this is not there is there is still

01:86:55.679 --> 01:86:57.040
moments the people aren't

01:86:57.040 --> 01:86:59.840
there is still ksi at the moment true

01:86:59.840 --> 01:87:01.199
well actually can't believe that i can't

01:87:01.199 --> 01:87:01.520
believe

01:87:01.520 --> 01:87:03.520
how many people apply to love island now

01:87:03.520 --> 01:87:05.120
versus say two years ago and how they

01:87:05.120 --> 01:87:07.920
still like mess up the casting

01:87:07.920 --> 01:87:11.199
yeah just how it is

01:87:11.199 --> 01:87:15.199
yeah um

01:87:15.199 --> 01:87:17.760
i mean that's pretty much it you know

01:87:17.760 --> 01:87:19.040
love island obviously

01:87:19.040 --> 01:87:21.440
but you don't watch that ksi show we got

01:87:21.440 --> 01:87:23.120
jj's album

01:87:23.120 --> 01:87:26.960

01:87:32.480 --> 01:87:33.199
stream right

01:87:33.199 --> 01:87:35.679
and he instantly just kind of went like

01:87:35.679 --> 01:87:36.239

he's

01:88:15.199 --> 01:88:16.560

01:88:16.560 --> 01:88:18.159

01:88:21.280 --> 01:88:22.639
leave the rest of us alone dude well

01:88:22.639 --> 01:88:23.679
didn't he admit that julian's just good

01:88:23.679 --> 01:88:24.960
or something i saw someone i saw someone

01:88:24.960 --> 01:88:26.639
tweet something that said like a

01:88:26.639 --> 01:88:28.159
list of chaotic wins you know something

01:88:28.159 --> 01:88:29.679
like ricegum

01:88:29.679 --> 01:88:31.760
admitting that his music actually is a

01:88:31.760 --> 01:88:34.800
higher level than his

01:88:34.800 --> 01:88:37.040
yeah he admit he has said at some point

01:88:37.040 --> 01:88:38.320
that he was jealous of chaos

01:88:38.320 --> 01:88:41.040
okay okay okay but yeah all right but

01:88:41.040 --> 01:88:42.159
everyone will probably just say no he

01:88:42.159 --> 01:88:43.199
hasn't

01:88:43.199 --> 01:88:46.880
um that's that's about it obviously

01:88:46.880 --> 01:88:48.880
now actually as well the day we are

01:88:48.880 --> 01:88:50.560
recording this

01:88:50.560 --> 01:88:54.000
freedom day no more masks no more

01:88:54.000 --> 01:88:55.440
restrictions

01:88:55.440 --> 01:88:59.280
yeah mad yeah i went into a shop

01:88:59.280 --> 01:89:02.400
earlier i thought today

01:89:02.400 --> 01:89:05.440
did i say did i not did i say that i

01:89:05.440 --> 01:89:06.400
just said that

01:89:06.400 --> 01:89:09.440
recording day yeah appointment well i

01:89:09.440 --> 01:89:11.280
literally went today

01:89:11.280 --> 01:89:12.239
but i thought it was only things where

01:89:12.239 --> 01:89:13.360
it's like when the podcast comes out

01:89:13.360 --> 01:89:14.400
today

01:89:14.400 --> 01:89:17.600
okay yeah masks are now yeah anyways uh

01:89:17.600 --> 01:89:19.360
yeah i went into a shop today i got a

01:89:19.360 --> 01:89:20.960
little little boost juice

01:89:20.960 --> 01:89:23.199
nice um i walked in and i was like i

01:89:23.199 --> 01:89:24.239
need to make sure i have my

01:89:24.239 --> 01:89:26.159
i have my mask i didn't i looked at

01:89:26.159 --> 01:89:27.199
everyone i was like no one's running

01:89:27.199 --> 01:89:28.400
their masks i think

01:89:28.400 --> 01:89:29.600
some company is a little quieter didn't

01:89:29.600 --> 01:89:31.760
they in it said i had to wear it

01:89:31.760 --> 01:89:33.440
laura she said do not get the two

01:89:33.440 --> 01:89:34.880
because she went to uh i think she into

01:89:34.880 --> 01:89:36.000
a massage

01:89:36.000 --> 01:89:37.920
massage today and she said her t-shirt

01:89:37.920 --> 01:89:39.280
was literally like

01:89:39.280 --> 01:89:40.719
you should have dripped in a bath go on

01:89:40.719 --> 01:89:42.400
the tube yeah

01:89:42.400 --> 01:89:43.920
i think i think i'm still gonna wear a

01:89:43.920 --> 01:89:46.000
mask on the tube for the next little bit

01:89:46.000 --> 01:89:47.840
just as like a safety yeah i think

01:89:47.840 --> 01:89:48.800
everyone out there as well i still let's

01:89:48.800 --> 01:89:50.159
be responsible with all this because

01:89:50.159 --> 01:89:51.199
like you've seen the numbers the numbers

01:89:51.199 --> 01:89:52.000
are getting mad again

01:89:52.000 --> 01:89:53.520
and um it's still i think like yeah

01:89:53.520 --> 01:89:55.520
still be safe i mean people people have

01:89:55.520 --> 01:89:56.960
mass before haven't they i know like i

01:89:56.960 --> 01:89:57.840
think in china people

01:89:57.840 --> 01:89:58.800
used to wear a lot of masks not

01:89:58.800 --> 01:90:00.000
necessarily for viruses i think that's

01:90:00.000 --> 01:90:01.040
more for the dust

01:90:01.040 --> 01:90:03.360
but in you know same way as like you

01:90:03.360 --> 01:90:04.080
know people will still

01:90:04.080 --> 01:90:05.840
sanitize their hands when there was

01:90:05.840 --> 01:90:07.520
there was no you know yeah

01:90:07.520 --> 01:90:09.199
still be safe that's one thing i

01:90:09.199 --> 01:90:12.320
definitely need to keep up is

01:90:12.320 --> 01:90:14.000
hygiene yeah that's true yeah i mean end

01:90:14.000 --> 01:90:15.679
of the day like i think didn't they say

01:90:15.679 --> 01:90:16.320
that

01:90:16.320 --> 01:90:17.920
in the pandemic i know it's gonna sound

01:90:17.920 --> 01:90:19.760
quite contradictory but like

01:90:19.760 --> 01:90:21.360
they've said that the regular you know

01:90:21.360 --> 01:90:22.800
regular flu cold

01:90:22.800 --> 01:90:24.880
has minimized because everyone's wearing

01:90:24.880 --> 01:90:26.719
masks and everyone's actually performing

01:90:26.719 --> 01:90:27.760
everyone's taking care of themselves

01:90:27.760 --> 01:90:29.360
more actually you know performing about

01:90:29.360 --> 01:90:30.880
hygiene that the regular colds have

01:90:30.880 --> 01:90:32.480
dropped a bit

01:90:32.480 --> 01:90:33.440
which would make sense isn't it

01:90:33.440 --> 01:90:34.639
obviously cover is still kicking about

01:90:34.639 --> 01:90:36.880
but the only thing i hate

01:90:36.880 --> 01:90:40.159
is using the anteback

01:90:40.159 --> 01:90:43.360
gel i always do it and then i'm like i

01:90:43.360 --> 01:90:44.719
want it i want to do it before i ate

01:90:44.719 --> 01:90:48.880
obviously because if you do it yeah yeah

01:90:48.880 --> 01:90:50.400
then you touch your food and it tastes

01:90:50.400 --> 01:90:52.320
gross yeah it's very strong isn't it

01:90:52.320 --> 01:90:54.320
yeah you're eating a chip or you like

01:90:54.320 --> 01:90:55.920
touch a straw oh it was at the end of

01:90:55.920 --> 01:90:57.600
the england game there was a wipe that

01:90:57.600 --> 01:90:59.280
was like an anti-bacterial alcohol wife

01:90:59.280 --> 01:91:00.320
you know you supposed to wash your hands

01:91:00.320 --> 01:91:01.600
and stuff but it was so sweaty at the

01:91:01.600 --> 01:91:03.600
game that i used to watch my face

01:91:03.600 --> 01:91:06.239
and my face was just burning stinging

01:91:06.239 --> 01:91:08.719
stinging yeah but you know i felt clean

they use like rubbing alcohol yeah and

01:91:33.840 --> 01:91:36.000
just do this until it comes off

01:91:36.000 --> 01:91:37.920
so our faces went bright red i got it

01:91:37.920 --> 01:91:39.920
mainly here around the cheeks he got it

01:91:39.920 --> 01:91:40.880
all over his face

01:91:40.880 --> 01:91:43.360

01:91:43.360 --> 01:91:44.800
you do you moisturize your face when you

01:91:44.800 --> 01:91:47.760
yeah yeah yeah we did that and he always

01:91:47.760 --> 01:91:49.040
describes it as the scene from home

01:91:49.040 --> 01:91:49.679
alone

01:91:49.679 --> 01:91:51.520
he literally put moisturizer on his face

01:91:51.520 --> 01:91:53.760
and then went

01:91:53.760 --> 01:91:56.880

01:91:56.880 --> 01:91:58.000

we're not going to show off too much

01:94:36.800 --> 01:94:37.920

01:94:52.080 --> 01:94:53.040

01:94:53.040 --> 01:94:56.080
he has been very

01:94:56.080 --> 01:94:59.119
that's right vacant i have mentally yeah

01:94:59.119 --> 01:94:59.760

01:95:01.040 --> 01:95:02.159
literally like i'm like a different

01:95:02.159 --> 01:95:02.960
person now

01:95:02.960 --> 01:95:05.280
yeah but we've built an amazing product

01:95:05.280 --> 01:95:06.159
and i can say that like

01:95:06.159 --> 01:95:07.440
everyone else who's starting these great

01:95:07.440 --> 01:95:09.119
companies you know they're using chinese

01:95:09.119 --> 01:95:10.880
cases that are just you know off alibaba

01:95:10.880 --> 01:95:11.440
they're using

01:95:11.440 --> 01:95:13.119
you know they're all model of the psa

01:95:13.119 --> 01:95:14.560
case no originality

01:95:14.560 --> 01:95:16.560
we've got you know eight graders been

01:95:16.560 --> 01:95:17.679
working for the last two and a half

01:95:17.679 --> 01:95:19.440
months training every single day nine to

01:95:19.440 --> 01:95:21.199
five to build the perfect service the

01:95:21.199 --> 01:95:22.320
perfect actual

01:95:22.320 --> 01:95:24.560
you know you know the integrity you need

01:95:24.560 --> 01:95:26.239
to have a grading company we're

01:95:26.239 --> 01:95:27.760
taking this very very seriously and i

01:95:27.760 --> 01:95:29.040
wouldn't even be involved with it if it

01:95:29.040 --> 01:95:29.840
wasn't

01:95:29.840 --> 01:95:31.360
top of the range and the best it can be

01:95:31.360 --> 01:95:32.719
and if it wasn't i would i would say

01:95:32.719 --> 01:95:33.440
let's pack it in

01:95:33.440 --> 01:95:36.159
let's stop but no it's it's it's gonna

01:95:36.159 --> 01:95:37.600
revolutionary and it's better than it's

01:95:37.600 --> 01:95:38.960
better than psa it's better than the big

01:95:38.960 --> 01:95:39.760
dogs and i think

01:95:39.760 --> 01:95:41.520
it is genuinely really sick like i'm not

01:95:41.520 --> 01:95:42.880
just saying this because he's here

01:95:42.880 --> 01:95:47.040
it is genuinely nicer than psa i'd say

01:95:47.040 --> 01:95:49.040
literally yeah like when i felt the case

01:95:49.040 --> 01:95:49.760
i was like you know what because

01:95:49.760 --> 01:95:50.719
obviously the case

01:95:50.719 --> 01:95:52.000
is taking months to get the case done

01:95:52.000 --> 01:95:53.119
because everyone else just buys it

01:95:53.119 --> 01:95:53.920
offline you know

01:95:53.920 --> 01:95:55.520
online story channel in like two seconds

01:95:55.520 --> 01:95:57.119
we've taken months to develop this case

01:95:57.119 --> 01:95:58.800
and when when i first held it i was like

01:95:58.800 --> 01:96:00.639
this is it this feels very premium

01:96:00.639 --> 01:96:02.080
that's what you want if you want a

01:96:02.080 --> 01:96:03.679
pokemon card right you've pulled it out

01:96:03.679 --> 01:96:05.280
of a box or whatever you know talia's

01:96:05.280 --> 01:96:06.480
first edition charlotte you want it to

01:96:06.480 --> 01:96:07.119
feel

01:96:07.119 --> 01:96:09.760
like it's premium because i mean

01:96:09.760 --> 01:96:11.440
actually questioned this yeah in the

01:96:11.440 --> 01:96:11.920
chat

01:96:11.920 --> 01:96:13.920
and randolph sent a video of him

01:96:13.920 --> 01:96:16.239
smacking a case against stuff

01:96:16.239 --> 01:96:18.560
no damage nothing no damage so it was it

01:96:18.560 --> 01:96:19.520
was he

01:96:19.520 --> 01:96:21.280
he has worked very hard on this and it

01:96:21.280 --> 01:96:23.119
is genuinely

01:96:23.119 --> 01:96:26.239
perfected so yeah and uh obviously it's

01:96:26.239 --> 01:96:27.440
still the start though so we've still

01:96:27.440 --> 01:96:29.119
obviously got plans to grow it and be

01:96:29.119 --> 01:96:30.880
even big i think one of the worries that

01:96:30.880 --> 01:96:32.080
a lot of these other great companies

01:96:32.080 --> 01:96:33.040
have you know is that

01:96:33.040 --> 01:96:34.560
the longevity but you know there's been

01:96:34.560 --> 01:96:35.920
a lot of money putting this a lot of

01:96:35.920 --> 01:96:37.760
time in a lot of investment into this

01:96:37.760 --> 01:96:39.119
like that like i said wouldn't have been

01:96:39.119 --> 01:96:40.480
done unless we were very serious about

01:96:40.480 --> 01:96:41.920
this so yeah i'm very proud so

01:96:41.920 --> 01:96:44.080
this friday on socials on my channel et

01:96:44.080 --> 01:96:45.119
cetera we're going to be announcing it

01:96:45.119 --> 01:96:46.480
properly and you know showing a bit more

01:96:46.480 --> 01:96:47.520
about it but

01:96:47.520 --> 01:96:49.280
generally it's the best and we're open

01:96:49.280 --> 01:96:50.719
very soon like we don't want to announce

01:96:50.719 --> 01:96:51.679
and then be like our

so many just sat on a shelf it's just

01:97:05.199 --> 01:97:06.400
it's just it's been horrible keeping

01:97:06.400 --> 01:97:08.000
this in and like i say like it's been

01:97:08.000 --> 01:97:09.199
you know certain things have to push it

01:97:09.199 --> 01:97:10.639

01:98:02.400 --> 01:98:04.000
potentially

01:98:04.000 --> 01:98:06.480
very potentially potentially with jj

01:98:06.480 --> 01:98:07.520
because he

01:98:07.520 --> 01:98:09.280
will yeah find out by the way he's free

01:98:09.280 --> 01:98:11.040
as well that's the other issue

01:98:11.040 --> 01:98:13.040
he may even if he does get it there's a

01:98:13.040 --> 01:98:14.320
very high chance he's just not free for

01:98:14.320 --> 01:98:17.360
a while

01:98:17.360 --> 01:98:18.880
we'll try our best yeah we'll try we're

01:98:18.880 --> 01:98:20.000
gonna say to him jj you've got number

01:98:20.000 --> 01:98:21.119
one run when you said this and if he

01:98:21.119 --> 01:98:22.800
says yeah then he'll be here if not

01:98:22.800 --> 01:98:23.199
he'll

01:98:23.199 --> 01:98:24.639

other podcasts and stuff and i'm

01:98:42.960 --> 01:98:45.600
thinking to myself like

01:98:45.600 --> 01:98:48.320
do our podcast bro yeah but he hasn't in

01:98:48.320 --> 01:98:49.040
the past and he will

01:98:49.040 --> 01:98:50.960
no i don't know he's probably he's the

01:98:50.960 --> 01:98:52.960
main reason we still do this doesn't he

01:98:52.960 --> 01:98:55.040
just to prove him wrong yeah originally

01:98:55.040 --> 01:98:56.560
that's where i came from yeah yeah well

01:98:56.560 --> 01:98:58.480

01:99:08.719 --> 01:99:09.600
there's no more progress in the world

01:99:09.600 --> 01:99:10.960
maybe we should start doing that

01:99:10.960 --> 01:99:12.320
he always said that about everything i

01:99:12.320 --> 01:99:14.239
know yeah with the number one number one

01:99:14.239 --> 01:99:15.280
hottest game in the

01:99:15.280 --> 01:99:17.199
game in the merch in the game yeah yeah

01:99:17.199 --> 01:99:18.960
yeah it works yeah it works

01:99:18.960 --> 01:99:20.719
she's gotta speak it into existence true

01:99:20.719 --> 01:99:22.080
manifest it yeah

01:99:22.080 --> 01:99:24.480
this is best grading service in the

01:99:24.480 --> 01:99:25.280
world

01:99:25.280 --> 01:99:27.520
well yeah but it is no already already

01:99:27.520 --> 01:99:28.320
though yeah yeah

01:99:28.320 --> 01:99:29.520
it's not even launched yeah well that's

01:99:29.520 --> 01:99:30.639
what actually it can't be the best

01:99:30.639 --> 01:99:32.239
without being no no i do agree

01:99:32.239 --> 01:99:33.679
but in the sense that like it we

01:99:33.679 --> 01:99:34.719
wouldn't even go for it if we didn't

01:99:34.719 --> 01:99:35.920
think it could be the best

01:99:35.920 --> 01:99:37.280
because i think a few people just to go

01:99:37.280 --> 01:99:38.239
back to this are trying to do it just to

01:99:38.239 --> 01:99:39.760
make a bit of money or try and like

01:99:39.760 --> 01:99:40.960
you know do something while it's hot but

01:99:40.960 --> 01:99:42.880
for us we're like we want it to be like

01:99:42.880 --> 01:99:44.159
we've got massive goals for this we've

01:99:44.159 --> 01:99:46.400
got huge huge huge plans in the next

01:99:46.400 --> 01:99:48.000
30 40 50 years so it's a long-term

01:99:48.000 --> 01:99:50.000
project for us and um again we wouldn't

01:99:50.000 --> 01:99:50.960
do it if we didn't think it could be the

01:99:50.960 --> 01:99:51.600
best

01:99:51.600 --> 01:99:53.360
so you know so therefore it is it will

01:99:53.360 --> 01:99:55.119
be sorry it will be

01:99:55.119 --> 01:99:56.880
