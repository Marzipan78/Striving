yo what's up guys and welcome back to
the what's good
podcast did you miss us i bet you did
because we're the best but bat that's my
fault
my fault there was no podcast last week
i was very ill uh
non-covered now you got ligma what's
like
have you seen the new disney film bro
i'm i'm gonna explain this in a second
okay but
um yeah i went to we went both
semi-finals
yep uh together yeah on a date it was
very romantic
yep and then i got ill during that
not covered had tests constantly had
tests here yeah it was not was not
covered i think it was just a case of
uh meeting people dapping hands
touching yeah face also stress stress
doesn't affect like
you know health yeah clearly
i'm stressed okay
um anyways is there something you want
to tell us is that is that no i'll tell
you
okay uh well yeah so i got i got a bit
ill
couldn't do anything for like four days
five days um
and that was in the podcast
era so yeah we didn't manage to do it
well so the conversation was like we
were gonna
maybe do uh an episode on discord but
we've kind of said
after you know covered the first big
lockdown after we came back we got the
studio
well the setup done and now the new
studio on the way we kind of want to
avoid doing discord episodes if we can
help it sometimes obviously in the
future we're going to have to there's
there'll be circumstances where we still
have to do discord but if we can't help
it i think it's better to
maybe delay it a week and then film it
in person properly um because we're just
trying to make sure the podcast just
keeps hitting new heights so we were
like we could do it on discord but it'll
be rushed
and sam was still feeling ill anyway um
so we're like you know what let's just
take a week off come back when um when
it hit when it's strong and also we had
jj's album coming out as well so
it's nice to you know kind of get that
focused and uh maybe the next episode
which is this one we can talk about that
as well so
i mean even even talking for like an
hour and a half was
i was like i can't do this i didn't
record your film yeah then stream for
six days
i didn't record i missed four days and
if you don't film
something's wrong i've never all the
time i've never not uploaded
i think the most i've missed on my
second channel is two days that's
imaginary
ever and that's eight years i mean
i mean uploads all the time i'm so lazy
and you posted
you weirdo yeah i did yeah yeah did you
i don't know
well i'll chat in a bit well since then
um we had the euros we haven't done one
since the semi-finals no
also that was the fact that that was a
fact as well it was from the day after
england
lost the euros and like everyone you
were
did you wake up depressed yeah i did it
all
it was very it was just really like
it sucked it's horrible like like
regardless of like oh you know we lost
like
that's hard to take it actually just
felt like it felt like everything just
kind of sucked it's just a way
in and obviously the way it is is the
way it is but it felt like the way it
was just was worse
yeah um i'm sure we'll get into like
some subjects later on
regarding the euros but it's just like a
dead feeling wasn't it
yeah was that you know when we lost to
croatia
that was different that was more like
we were all angry yeah because it was
like oh you know we could have won that
oh but we
[ __ ] up this one yes we we could have
won obviously it went to penalties
secondly
uh you know we were one ill up yeah and
then we just kind of sat back a bit but
it it just felt like it felt like it's
because it was so close
yeah that's right yeah and yeah we
weren't angry at anyone it was like well
you know i mean some people were angry
some people were angry yeah
shame on you shame on you it was just
like it just was what it was like it was
like
it was not you can't blame anyone like
we had a great run the players did
everything they could have the manager
did everything he could have the country
was really happy in terms of like
the overall run it was kind of like well
there's just nothing
it just got halted yeah yeah it was like
oh oh we're doing it
what happened yeah what happened
whatever you say about the game itself i
think both teams could have won like
they both
but both if anyone won they would
deserve to win no no but like
usually like if even one would have
deserved to win if italy won they would
have deserved to win
yeah so and whoever scores more goals
normally wins
cheers mclaren
[Laughter]
yeah that was uh also really sad ksi
dropped an album
ksi did a show um we were in the show
logan paul i was gonna move on to all of
this no no but i'll just survive enough
your voice okay
okay keep vibing good vibes only logan
paul and the sidemen
bow um yeah what else happened
uh other stuff
do you want me to look yeah love alan's
on love alan's on but i've only just
found out
that he doesn't watch her anymore do you
no i i just it's boring this time so you
don't watch anymore no
i would love to it's just it's just bad
it's not good now
you agree you have to agree oh it's
awful it's terrible
but i still watch it i thought we had i
thought we could have some
you know some chats if i've been if i
was at home i probably would watch it
but i've been away
i'm i'm broken i'm a broken man now
i'm in a deep bit of depression but it's
all right i'm here now on the podcast
go sports okay um
yeah no the the euros was very upsetting
um i mean we went to the germany game
though that wasn't yeah that was sick
unreal that was that probably was the
best best game
over them all yeah i mean the final
obviously was
a different vibe because it was yeah of
course yeah but i actually preferred
the atmosphere and also i was sat in a
different place yeah we were in
atmosphere
also the german fans as well it was it
wasn't experienced well
start with aj it was nice as well yeah
that was that was a that was a great day
that
that one yeah not the next one i had to
drive tomorrow yeah i went to drive to
my dad's to watch it
so i did a six-hour round trip to watch
the game just because i don't have like
you know uh obviously the world cup is
on
sorry the euros or the world cup i'm bbc
or iplayer
um and i don't have like i don't have a
skybox i'm not like a virgin i don't
have it
i don't even have a free view no
surprise i know because i'm one
not really well i've just hoped not
but what i'm saying is when you watch
premier league it doesn't really matter
you know if someone scores
worse is you see like someone texts in
the group doesn't it matter yeah um
if you if you care that much turn your
phone off whereas
for the euros if if anyone scored no
matter what tv was
i would hear it from a flat oh laura
would hear it from the flat so when we
went to the football she would always
hear her shout out and text me what's
happened
obviously she watched the files in the
later games but so i was like right i
can't watch the final in my flat because
no matter what happens i'm going to hear
something
um because i don't i don't watch the
direct source i watch it on like bbc
iplayer or whatever so i was like right
i have to go drive to someone who has
the game
my brother had it but then like you know
i think his kids are going to watch the
first half
and um you know they've got neighbors
and i will take it seriously i don't
want to be like screaming in front of
the kids yeah especially
the kids are kind of like yeah whereas
you are [ __ ]
you know so yeah i just decided to drive
to my dad's my mum and dad
um and watch it there and that was hard
watch great great watch but
at the end it was just depressing yeah
so we've
we've moved on uh from the euros
kind of what we'll say as well we're
going to talk about is this is this the
chat now
about euros unless you want to know
because i always start the podcast i'm
always like this is what's to come and
then we start getting into
it and i'm like this is now this is now
it so what i will say is
i do think however that i know it's
gonna hurt
saying this and it's gonna be it's gonna
sound wrong but it's like an open-minded
thought
i think always losing especially in the
way we did was kind of like
good for the country and good for
longevity and it's good in the fight
against racism
in total obviously you can't really take
that you know it's bad what happened but
i feel like everyone together because of
it
and the backlash that obviously like
because of the like people tweeting et
cetera everyone kind of united a bit
more
yeah yeah of course i wish raisins
wanted a thing anyway like i'm not happy
it happened because if it didn't happen
it didn't happen that'd was great
but it was just masking it yeah i think
like it's stuff like this just
if if the players can like band together
and if we as a country combined together
it tackles it
at a larger scale yeah more so than if
we'd win because i feel like the people
who have a go people who are racist like
they they're just jealous and insecure
people as a whole so what i'm saying i
don't want them to celebrate
when you know say stack of scores a
penalty i don't want them to be happy
there you know with themselves being a
racist but just not
you know you want them to be out
basically yeah i want you to feel bad
make sense yeah i get that
but obviously no of course i still like
to win but
yeah of course i still want to win but
i'm happy to see that you know you see
rashford and sancho on the plane like
rapping with like the jury on that was
an old clip was it i was like
apparently it was a year old i've
invaded yeah but then well all the
players i think
that's why i saw the comments devon rice
makes them out jumping off boats and
stuff
everyone everyone's happy and i feel
like that group of players has really
done well
um and i think you know i think it's
been great the you know the support that
the players have had you know i was
really surprised about right so
that was on the sunday like two or three
days ago
i went and helped theo film something it
was a football thing i was wearing an
england shirt yeah i had three people
telling me to take the shirt off and not
in a sexual way not like oh baby take
that shirt off
not like that they literally say it like
one of them literally yeah exactly yeah
one of them literally was just like are
we lost what
what why are you wearing that take it
off she'd be more proud and i was like
would you like how is this how's the
thing i hate it like
england haven't ceased to exist because
yeah yeah yeah yeah
and that's again it felt different this
time like obviously it hurt more
but also it felt better because it's
like oh we didn't deserve to lose we
just lost you know
so i i think in the world cup we're
gonna be even better you gotta remember
these players are young as well and
after what happened they're gonna be
stronger as well they're gonna have more
of a
point to prove and a great group of
people and that's why i think
i saw people saying like uh southgate
come out india's i'd love to be able to
host a team and for the world cup i'm
like why is that even a thing like
first managing what 55 years to take you
know to take the team to a major
championship and you can tell that like
no matter what you think of him
tactically you can tell that the group
of players
like respect him a lot and the group the
the ethos we've got is so good there
confidence is high free players doing
whatever they want to do you know
it seems like a very nice camp to be
involved in whereas before you had like
you know
we could actually dice as a manager like
that that would have been just you know
taking the whole country back a bit but
now i'm really excited for the
players and i'm happy for them yeah yeah
i think that is the euros talk now
yeah it was done guys yeah yeah and it
was a very abstract thought as well i'm
not saying that i'm not glad it happened
i'm just saying that like you know
i know what you mean as people i think
it does just you know it's not just
football now it's it's
as as a freight not a race is it what
yeah as a human race it like progressed
progresses what's important
which is not racism by the way we never
talk about stuff that's deep
but no it's very new for the podcast
it's an important one obviously we
didn't talk about last week last week
would have been
would have been like really angry all
you know all the idiots in the world but
now it's more like a reflection and
thinking like sorry i'm you sound like
ksi ad-libs
[Music]
oh man but another supporting event uh i
went to the f1
oh yeah and i'm not a big f1 fan
i have many times said i find it a
little bit boring yeah
we have been to formula e together we
have been formula e
yeah but i went to formula one because
uh team quadrant big up lando norris
team
did you say to them can canada come to
podcast
i didn't [ __ ] he can basically do stuff
in the winter is what we found out
when he's okay like so he's not allowed
to see people so after the after the
race
he wasn't allowed to come get a drink
with us i'm mad that he has to stay in a
box
vic's not in he got a phone no so vic
was in so
basically say the thing is like a circle
yeah the whole venue is a circle
in the middle is the green zone
everywhere else is the red zone
right if you leave the green zone you
can't go back in you're contaminated
so vic was in the green zone with he
went with like i think channel four
yeah uh so he was in there he wasn't vic
wasn't allowed to see us
wow so it was like it was okay he wasn't
allowed to see us but if he did come see
us he wasn't allowed to go back in yeah
yeah yeah
so can you can you remember how hot
those tents were for formula e so you
know where the cars are can you imagine
what they've been like this week
oh was it hard for you just being there
yeah
but part of that was we found out
i'm i'm was literally about to leave i'm
three minutes away from getting in a cab
yeah and toby quoted something in our
group chat
about a uh dress code
and i was like i wasn't in this group
chat when the dress code was put in
so i was like if toby didn't quote this
i was about to turn up in basketball
shorts and a t-shirt so if you join a
chat
after because honestly that old message
can someone stole quotes from them from
before
but then i can't click it yeah you can
just see i could see the start said like
dress code
for the event and then i couldn't see
anything yeah so uh because toby sent
that i was like wait there's a dress
code and you panicked they quoted it
again
and it was like you have to wear uh
smart trousers
or jeans so i went in jeans um
or smart shorts but i didn't have them
so i went in jeans and you have to wear
a collared shirt
so i was boiling yeah like boy
because that was a hot date yeah it was
on sunday but did you see that today
they actually i think
for the first time ever they put out
like a extreme heat warning
mud what was it like some sort of like
level of
yeah the first ever met office like a
major announcement for the heat
bro my balcony is like wooden and you
know when you go when you get like dubai
say or you're someone that's really like
humid humid heart and you can actually
smell like the wood burn
yeah the restaurant went in dubai like
the floor was like like a deck and i
could smell the vocally like burnin
balcony yeah it's english
i'm absolutely prison balcony yeah okay
um
but yeah i went to i went to that uh
crash
bolt well it wasn't on the corner yeah
there are screens everywhere but yeah
i'm never i'm
not really an f1 fan but obviously i
wasn't a formulary fan
we went and we all enjoyed it did you so
i've also tried to start this new thing
of saying yes to more opportunities yeah
yeah josh put in the chat like does
anyone want to go
um i think ethan was meant to go
and then ethan couldn't go and i
messaged josh and i was like look if
no one else is going yeah yeah i'll go
obviously anyone who actually
is like an f1 fan go ahead of me yeah
yeah but if no one else is and joshua's
like oh no it's you know it's
very last minute if you want to come
come on as well when someone asks you
something i just feel bad that i'm
taking someone who maybe would like it
more
yeah i mean like if someone invited me
to a football match yeah for example
like like when you get into the
semi-finals stuff like that like euros
it is very you know you love football
yeah f1 was very
out of character yeah convention if you
if you were there and then someone at
home was like oh man
i'm a massive f1 fan although i think
you know the
incidence of f1 you know obviously uh
verstappen and hamilton haven't
come together i don't know whose fault
it i i don't know i don't know enough
about the sport
but what he is doing to me is making me
more interested in the sport
yeah i'm like oh that's kind of cool i'm
not sorry sorry hold on
it wasn't cool that van gogh
hospitalized but it was like an event
no i mean ever everyone around me was
saying there was a lot of people around
me who weren't like massive f1 fans they
all liked it but they weren't massive
fans yeah
is it bad that i kind of want them to
crash i know
i was like everyone does they everyone
wants everyone to be safe
yeah of course but you want to see
someone spin out you well you want to i
think
so a lot of people like i think this in
f1 is a very big topic right now
everyone's like oh
um hamilton should have done that
whereas other people are saying you know
max always drives quite aggressively so
it was going to happen eventually
whether it was
maybe hamilton who's found out or max
who's for now or sorry not spent out
got hit but at the same time um yeah
it's like
people want to see people want to see
them go head-to-head so if you want to
see those like close calls those actual
like intense moments
yeah and that's that again is a
spectator sport right like like all
sports are so i think you know
yeah yeah but then the ending of it was
mental i don't know if you have yeah
leclerc right say his name charles clerk
because he didn't they almost have like
well hamilton got a 10 second delay yeah
was in
fifth or sixth or something yeah and
then he had something like
eight laps or no 13 laps and had to make
up 10 seconds
mad and it was like every lap so we're
on this corner it was called
brooklyn's corner baby now brooklyn
all right yeah like brook land now just
singing jay-z didn't ask
we're on a corner that's like a almost
like an s yeah
and every lap you just see hamilton that
little bit closer yeah that's so amazing
it was you know it was started off 10
seconds apart yeah the next lap he's oh
he's nine
that is now he's eight and it was
amazing that was amazing
that's where like f1 becomes enjoyable
like on the surface if you're not into
the sport
it seems very boring doesn't it like the
the start's really great the end's
really great but it's like
why are everyone so into it for the rest
of it but i think it's the data isn't it
like
the seconds that they can shave off you
know the the here and there so i think i
would like to get into it i might have
to watch the
netflix show yeah everyone around me
said that's what actually got me into it
yeah yeah yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna give
that a watch
i've been working i'm an f1 i'm an f1
fan now not
not a mad fan maybe we'll cuddle
together and watch it maybe
probably not oh that's gonna hold you to
that maybe but you've said it on the
podcast now
i've said maybe i've never seen no no no
no no you said yeah yeah maybe
they said yeah first you're a cuddle
yeah yeah
that's my cuddle really um nah but yeah
so guys
f1 thing is i was watching it with my
brother the day of four actually um and
he did that first ever sprint didn't
there and if you didn't see it saturday
did you no so we only went sunday yeah
but i think they're trying out a new
sprint where it's just like 17 laps yeah
and i was asking my brother so i think
perez or someone or pereira i don't know
who
someone like split out and then uh my
brother was like oh he's out of it now
like he's going to be bottom of
course but then i noticed that like he
recovered a little bit
and he wasn't bottom he was like 18
and it was someone 19th and 20th and
that was like half i think the team
called us
which apparently you're in draft to
survive and they're quite funny
oh okay so yeah they came last yesterday
yeah yeah
they were the team that toby started
supporting them um
when they were already losing yeah when
they got lapped and they had been lapped
by like three people
and then a couple laps later they've
been that by four yeah yeah yeah by five
lap by six well
i from what i've heard they are amazing
it's just the cars
yeah but also no so may's pin one of
them he's not even
like a i mean he's a f1 racer obviously
but his dad just like owns a team or it
does like mega rich oh really
like russian dynamics my brother's
telling me that anyway so just
she bought a spot in the team she just
always laughs back
he's just sat there like driving along
like airports
yeah yeah i think of course like mclaren
and all the teams they back they buy
into the f1 similar to how a lot of
other sports things work so i guess
where you got hamilton he could
obviously get sponsored at a younger age
because he's so talented you know and
they
pay for him to get his spot in yeah
whereas this bloke's just like i don't
know
the fact that someone spun out and like
you had to recover you still come in
like last just
this is a heads up neither of us know
anything yeah i could be absolutely
completely wrong
yeah if we've said anything wrong take
it with a pinch of salt yeah
or you know and if you do something put
something in the comments make it like a
construction yeah constructive yeah
because we want to get into it and
if you're a f1 fan you want to be
accepting newcomers and one day we'll
learn so shut
up that's what i hate i hate people that
are like oh
uh you shouldn't be going if you don't
like it and i'm like well i mean i did
offer it to
everyone else first and also i
i haven't got into it yeah everyone
starts somewhere but yeah i haven't got
into it by watching it on tv
or anything like that but me going to
this one event
has now made me actually go oh when's
the next one on like
i'll actually watch it yeah and then
obviously f1 is a huge sport but it's
like you have certain areas where it
obviously can get
stronger so i know you know um lawrence
mckenna he put a basketball documentary
out which is
actually really good like you should
check it out if you want obviously
because basketball is something huge in
america right in the uk it's quite
it's it's everyone loves it a lot of
people enjoy it but it's less
cared about it's focused on so i think
it's harder there's less funding you
know it's harder for teens to grow up a
place to get good at and stuff so they
made a documentary just kind of like
grow
mba in the uk and that's a similar thing
where some people might be like
oh you know nothing about basketball man
don't you know whereas you never get a
chance
yeah it's the same way as like like
women's football as well or say
mls or soccer you know it's like you you
joke about it people joke on it but then
it never really it can never grow unless
you have to actually accept yeah
yeah there's some men's football that's
worse than women's football for sure
yeah yeah and obviously like back in the
day like knights football eighties
football was
atrocious at times it's just like you
know you have to get somewhere so
yes sir hate with me for going to that
and if you do vic went to the euros
final
[Laughter]
but we worked out well vic's vic's only
been
two football matches ever so far on
final yeah
too fair vic too fair though has played
in more matches in stadiums than he's
been to that's gangsta that's gangster
as well
yeah right he's played in three stadiums
or three matches in stadiums
i'm going to play in the next um
football match
you don't decide that nah but no well
i'm gonna get fit for it okay i'm gonna
put myself into contention
whether i mean or not okay and when i
say seven matches it might not be
i didn't say charity match i started
football match okay so if you go for a
want to play kick that well speaking of
getting fit for a football match yeah
seeing chunks
yeah yeah he smashed him well he's
obviously playing soccer right now yeah
now i need to be called thunks like thin
chunks thunks surely he should be called
like
thins yeah
it should like instead of edit the
podcast
but then also if you give if you go
thunk she's like trunks out of dragon
ball z and
he's gone he's been super saiyan how
about that but why has he got
like a it's like trunks with a speech
impediment though
funks sounds like calyx
but no trunk smashed honestly not only
is he lost weight he's fit what i'm
saying is getting fitter
that's a big part of it a lot of people
just try and get thin by like killing
themselves by you know
restraining from any sort of like fun in
life whereas he's not the right way so
yeah and he's been
he's been playing in like so many
charity matches as well keep seeing
he's doing well and again you know why
did this get brought on
who knows why but he didn't miss a
penalty he did insecurity that could
have pushed him on so
sakura 10 years gonna be the best play
in the world
that's true yeah maybe who knows he's
good i've heard a lot of stories about
sakura you know since
you know um he's been in the world cup i
saw her you know you know
did you mean the euros again yes that's
sake man
yeah i did that's like three times that
no i just guys i'm just pressured
this podcast is sponsored by better help
online
therapy yeah obviously life is full of
stresses it doesn't matter who you are
or what you have
your life is probably stressful yeah
that you can have a lot going for you
you know think you're doing really well
in one aspect especially with what we do
we're like
public facing you know we've been quite
successful with what we do but
that's still there can leave you feeling
awful and you still have days where you
like you just feel
like crap but then you also have to
pretend like you're happy to everyone
else
um so it can be difficult yes you may
not be feeling down and out and
depressed or like you
you're at a total loss uh but if your
stress is high your temper is shorter
than usual and even if you're starting
to feel strain in any of your
relationships
you could probably use the chance to
unload especially when it's hot
when it's hot makes it worse isn't it
everything's worth it it's not always on
edge yeah yeah so
unload the stress and you also can't
sleep which effects
unload the stress and get it out talk to
some
not it though talk to someone who's
completely unbiased about your life
someone who isn't going to judge you or
take sighs on anything when there are
things that you can't tell anyone or
feel like you can't unload to family or
friends
you need to unload it and that's what
that's what therapy can be
so better help is customized online
therapy that offers videos
phone and even live chat sessions with
your therapist so you don't have to see
anyone on camera if you don't want to
it's much more affordable than in-person
therapy and you can start communicating
with your therapist in
under 48 hours unload the stresses and
get some unbiased feedback you'd be
pretty surprised at what you might gain
from it see if it's for you

podcast okay uh we'll move on
to with the world cup the world cup
probably the biggest topic of this week
obviously euros was last week yeah
um the biggest topic i would say for
us not in the world yes that's
outrageous
ksi's album launched it's out now it
came out friday
it's today's wednesday today this yeah
we're filming this on monday so go and
stream it go and buy it if you haven't
bought it yet on itunes still going to
stream it a lot because
the charts are and friday so you've as
you're watching this you've still got
time to make a difference
and we made a deal with him last time he
was on that he would come on
the next time he got a number one and he
can't even turn it down
we literally will show him the clip and
go [ __ ] it's in your flat yeah he'll
punch us both
knuckles and he'll sit here and be like
okay how long do i have to do this for
but we get views we do get views we get
ksi and we get views he's been in this
one since
the studio i don't think so i really
like
considering the meme of me obviously
like using ksi being
only being here bro i filmed two videos
with him this year yeah one was a
mukbang so i literally just said to him
i will provide you with food can you
just talk for 20 minutes yeah and we're
now in the second half of the year
and the other one was i bought him a
very expensive cake to help with the
album as well that would helped
yeah yeah and that was all because his
album was being wholesome wholesome
simon also
i think we probably would have to get
him in quite quick because it will be
much harder to get him to come to a
studio to film
yeah true than you know here yeah
but the album came out friday yeah very
good album
uh we're gonna run through the album
quick i'll get it on my phone and
yeah we're not going to do like a proper
tier list or anything because
i think we're both going to do them on
our own channels so make sure you check
them out
somehow or like listenings
i don't know yeah yeah yeah and then
maybe next week or in the future we'll
then like compare
each other's tier lists that's an idea
we had yeah for sure we'll see
so we have uh one second
sorry ksi firstly he also overtook six
nine in
as big monthly listeners 9.6 million
yeah
oh sp before we get into it speaking of
smart
promotional musicians so you know little
nars x
yeah i was going to tell sorry for the
podcast but i was like wait podcast
content okay
so you know how he did that thing where
he reached the devil's shoes or satan's
shoes yeah and then nike was supposedly
suing him
this whole week especially today he's
been pushing that he's going to court
he's like he's been like i might be in
jail tonight
or might be in jail next week and he was
quite seriously he was doing it very
very seriously
putting tweets about like this that
doing tick tocks saying this that like
if i was
in jail um and then uh and then
it turned out that he put out a video of
like
him in court you know he's the lawyer
he's the uh he's the
you know always played out music videos
a trailer someone like a trailer or a
skit i'd say probably skit's the best
thing
to promote his new song so it's all just
to promote his new song but like
that's very good it was the way it was
doing was just like done to perfection
um and it's produced who is it might
want to google it it's produced by kanye
west and someone else
featuring a song yeah yeah i think go to
his twitter he'll
if you have the app or twitter.com or
whatever yeah he'll um
he's just so smart and i think jj in
little little decks are quite similar in
terms of the way they promote things
because obviously they're both people
who
um have like garnished an audience oh
industry baby
coming out july 23rd yeah is it
featuring
uh
[Music]
so no oh jack harlow yeah uh
who is like the man at the moment right
now doing a lot of big things i think
it's produced by kanye west
someone else and kanye west so a big
that's a bigger
big star star cast man and all that just
to promote a song and
again it reminds me of jj like like
leveraging you know social media now
yeah back in the day everyone laughed at
jj for being like a youtuber and a
musician and now
you know he said he's getting you know
people are paying him to come on his
songs now
and paying him to promote them so yeah
smart what's the feature now they want
to feature me
yeah what a bar good lyric yeah you know
my favorite logo the whole album
what i have two gone my two favorite
lyrics
are one uh
i can't remember the exact wording but
it's uh
how can they cancel when the only thing
that made me was me
that lyric i'm like dope there's a bar a
sick line
there's a bar and the second one is
bugsy malones oh that's yeah where he
goes like you're okay they think you're
they think you're just a youtuber and
i'm just a grime artist how have they
not seen the
businessmen yeah they're not seeing the
money we make we're businessmen
i like that as well because because uh
boogie's been one of the you know
obviously a lot of people support jj but
boogie's been one that's
supporting from the start as well before
like before it was called to be a ksi
fan or you know ksi collaborator he was
there then
so yeah when it was a little bit risky
for uh
someone that's cool to co-sign to be on
a ksi
song and stuff and obviously bugsy was
boxing him and stuff like that yeah yeah
yeah it was always it was always very
they were very cool yeah for sure for
sure
that's so sick and yeah it's just good
to see uh one line that i do find it
really funny though you've seen the uh
fantano clip so you know if fantano
anthony phillips didn't know anthony
fantano he does the is a critic
you know youtube critic does really well
um he does like every time an album
comes out or a project he does a stream
on twitch that way that listens to it i
saw a little bit of that but he doesn't
he does another video that's
actually a breakdown to review it
properly yes that's like his first
listen then he'll review it properly
but uh there it goes something like uh
sorry the tweet goes or the tick tock
girl or something like
fontana i couldn't even comprehend what
jj just said um
in the lyric goes something like uh i'm
on their head like a beanie i'm sorry
head like i'm wearing a beanie yeah yeah
and then he just stops he goes
for ages it's like it's like one of
those ones where you can't tell if he's
like
he's a genius or if he's like what did
you just say
i think you should to be interpreted but
jj has a lot of free lines doesn't he
there's one that's like um
horny like a rhino watching porn it was
just so
weird well obviously the one about
harry's mom obviously which is a good
line to be fair but it's just very
you like what what did you just swerve
though as well yes and swerve yeah just
on the albums on the premium album on
spotify
yeah but it's still not his song i don't
think no no it's they didn't look good
you do a song for me song for you on the
album type thing but um no it's just
funny because i remember when we
did a lot of the old songs with jj that
new age and also someone just the
simulation like
you'd be recording right i'm like
recording listening and he'll say
something i'd just be like
what the [ __ ] did you say it's just like
polarizing you know i'm saying like
which a lot of artists do a lot of what
i just said stupid stuff in their songs
oh youtube compilation of people saying
stupid stuff but i have a whole series
based around it rap or crap
exactly yeah exactly it's probably yours
thinking of them um so it's just
it's nice to see because and again it
just it grabs the attention so whether
it's a good line or not you're still
going like
what did he say what did he say um so
it's good it just gets people talking
and that's the best thing you can do
very true very true now i mean skepta
has also been yeah
shouting him out which is a very that's
another cool look big coastline yeah and
two fears has always shown support as
well
oh yeah like we've done loads of
obviously because of jamie and stuff we
do a lot of like
boy better no events yeah like yeah
whatever they do we're always there
etcetera and stuff like
short he was actually at the f1
yesterday yeah and yeah
uh jamie was somewhere jamie was there
as well with shawty and bizzle did you
see him but jamie left
about half an hour 45 minutes after
something yeah obviously we
you gotta remember like we just say that
oh you know shout out boys for
supporting from the start
it still was a bit uncool for a lot of
them to support jj so it's very you know
it's very viable as well it's a very
like fair thing to do but
skepta has always like especially in
private oh yeah you've been a fan you
know
yeah but i mean like people yeah people
like to me that
shows me how cool the artist is as a as
a person yeah
not actually like cool yeah you know i
mean yeah because like someone like
jamie
p money yeah yeah all these people who
are literally
big zoo as well yeah all of them who
literally they kind of heard jj
doing his thing and they were like yeah
he's sick yeah that was it
yeah you know why are you looking at it
it's like oh it's crazy youtuber yeah
well some people did that though some
people did like actually
oh yeah whether it was public or
privately maybe some maybe sometimes jj
you're trying to get a song on someone
they're like oh they don't do that
whereas like you know shout out to and
shout out to swayze is also fair sway
had the first like proper vision of like
jd complete mainstream yeah for sure
i had the first vision but i couldn't do
it about it yeah yeah you were you were
like the ogog well
i was like you could be big but i mean
what [ __ ] can i do about it
[Music]
yeah yeah yeah okay well two to be
better a lot of like people our age now
will have grown all
without being their favorite song
imagine that husky time yeah
everyone always says it everyone always
says like oh like oh it's case i'm going
to perform heavy time this time
or you know well everyone thought you
know my me being in this ksi show was
going to be hefty time
that'd be mad it would've been mad you
know what they don't we'll talk about
the ksi yeah we'll get into it
but imagine obviously heskey's in it
yeah
wearing a full kit imagine how much did
you know if i'm hesitant i'm like yeah
i'll be in it but then when they said
like you want to be in a full kit
why did he say yeah bro
you could just you don't
you have to go in full socks mate no
offense i do love you you're a great guy
you know but it would have been sick if
his part of the skit
had been brought in by you and jj doing
beerus
yeah yeah and then you start asking time
yeah and he's like
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa chill out and
then that part
just that first like done yeah yeah
that song is amazing it's actually quite
good in it like
it is the beat like the flow just feels
nice to listen to i mean jj's part is
very questionable yeah yeah
yeah yeah but yeah the actual yeah as a
song it's actually
yeah um yes we got the moment first
yeah yeah very good song very i love
that song am i one of my favorites
the first time you played it to me as
well i was like i don't want to be mean
because i don't mean it in a bad way
but it isn't it sounds like an intro
song and yeah it's the intro i was like
it's a sick intro song because my one of
my favorite songs on the last album
was the intro song yeah what she's been
on right yeah yeah that's like one of my
favorite songs of it i think this one
might be my
one of my favorites on the whole album
it's definitely one of my favorites i
keep singing in my head
yeah no it's definitely definitely uh i
don't care
which is one thing we'll say at the end
of the season
i'll say now but you'll see it at the
end is his solo songs
are really good yeah which i'm so happy
about because
it's so easy for jj to get slated for
carried by
uh whatever collabs and it's like
we're at what point is he not like his
highest chartered song right now
is a solo song holiday yeah yeah yeah
well it's good actually because
jade has grown a lot but what i'll say
as well is often
when you when you're in a situation that
did is now right where he's like he's
doing really well you've also got a lot
of like uh
say say not managers just say oh you've
got like
maybe label people that are like oh you
should do this whereas as an artist
especially someone who doesn't have much
charisma or the ability to
have your own say which changes jj can
do that by the way he's the best that
he's best saying i want to do my own
thing
yeah but other people in the industry
might you know not have the pilot just
got
said you know someone might say i'll do
this do that and they have to do it
otherwise just gonna get dropped by the
label or locked into a contract whereas
a lot of jj solo stuff is him being like
now this is me now this is what i really
want to do
but at the same time he's like go out of
his comfort zone as well like the
holiday song wouldn't have been his idea
he's not going to sit there and be like
i want to make like a
yeah but somebody's been like you know
try out you know do this do that you
know maybe maybe express yourself and
now it's really paid off so this album
is definitely both of them combining
um and the reason him on his own is so
good is yes people i can't say are you
getting carried by a feature but also
you start to hear jj as like uh himself
yeah for sure you know
with no features because sometimes the
features you pander to their style as
well if i'm gonna make a song with
say talia it'd be very different to the
song that i'll make with jj
where you when you're on your own it's
like this is me now so shout out jj
i have a very i was trying to remember i
i thought something a minute ago and i
was like
that's a really funny not funny point
but it's a really interesting thing that
i was going to say
yeah and then i realized i forgot it
yeah and now i remembered
anthony fantano yeah rated jj's last
album
of four okay so we have our whole yellow
red card system with sidemen right
obviously
you know you get a yellow card for being
late or missing something et cetera you
get
two yellow cards you get the red card
and if you get a red card yeah you
uh lose a video in the grand schemes of
things you have to do more what
we've got a wager on the table i'm
guessing harry just
harry said if anthony fontano gives
a rating above six he'll take the red
card
wow so what's jj's stands on what what's
jj's prediction i don't
[Music]
i mean based on i watched a bit of the
live stream
his his audience is one of the most
toxic audiences that i've ever seen
and i get that he he is toxic in a sense
like he's like his whole persona is kind
of toxic
not in a bad way but more of like you
know i'm this harsh critic you know
you know he's got his own his own lane
right yeah i mean i get
i get you know he breaks it down he
knows the music
if he doesn't like it he doesn't like it
that's that's fair enough yeah but to me
ultimately well to everyone music
is subjective it's yeah yeah well it's
subjective but there's still
you still have the right to critique it
though no no 100 100
but that doesn't make your opinion any
more valid than anyone else's
no but if you're if you are a music
critique then like
he's so fanta is more whether whether
you think he's credible or not that's
that's the subjective as well but
he is more versed in music than we are
well
yeah yeah it turns like compositions and
times for example structure you know a
lot more than me about music
like making a song for example so there
might be like a
a kick drum that it happens every
now and then and it's offbeat yeah and
you're like i can't listen to that song
it's offbeat
this is awful yeah and i'm like i just
like this song it just sounds sick
that doesn't and i'd rate the song you
know nine out of ten you're like
oh that out of time it just kind of
annoys me it's like a five yeah for sure
that doesn't make the opinion
in neither of our opinions no you're
right yeah so cool yeah so
fantano has a right to give his opinion
and he's probably got a good opinion
trivia you know if you subscribe to
his thoughts then go for it but just
what he said doesn't affect shouldn't
affect what you should think for
yourself yeah exactly like i watch a lot
of reaction videos yeah yeah
and like subconsciously maybe i
am swayed a bit like uh i don't know
laid back whatever yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah like i'll watch him and
i might be swayed a little bit
subconsciously but i try to
you know i'll listen to a song before i
watch him yeah normally yeah
because he might go oh this one's trash
and then i'm kind of like i quite like
that song yeah that's not going to make
me go
yeah actually this song's an l yeah
think a song blah blah blah which i feel
like obviously a lot of
kids who watch reaction videos and stuff
will actually speak especially fantastic
people will wait to see what his opinion
is before they give their opinion
and i i think that's outrageous
obviously a lot of them are kids so it's
like whatever like yeah
but yeah he's got a right to his opinion
so has any um uh
anyone but also you know he can say what
he wants from the album yeah he has a
right to voices for sure yeah yeah
whereas obviously he would have
hesitated one but as we just said like
in context of the song ahead of time
he's quite funny so like you know we
would score it higher but again you know
yeah musically you give it one but
although someone would like to differ
but we also we are biased with that with
ksi for sure right oh you know 100
i am 100 bias i will always like
i will always think think of it better
well let's think maybe i don't think of
it as better but i don't think i would
allow myself to think of it as bad
yeah so out of the whole album i'm
looking at it and going like oh
this song or this song is okay
and a lot of other people are going that
song's actually a stinker yeah
yeah and also we're probably less biased
to this one because we heard less of it
like we heard
quite a bit of it but certain times
certain songs were surprised you know
i'm like wow like holiday we all kind of
heard that for the first time
it still was before the album but
everyone's like wow it's kind of you
know down and especially the
we'll get into it later but um one of
the tracks that we play is all our
favorites
we heard for the first time everyone's
vibing so i think jd wanted that as well
because
again you don't want your friends to
like be too involved because you want to
surprise them as well you want to listen
to it as a fan
yeah um but no it's just yeah it's great
to see him doing well already but
i did see someone compare it to like uh
was it kendrick lamar's like damn album
and that's pretty bit far isn't it oh as
in so it was like same level yeah yeah
yeah well yeah it's it's like i see
people online saying
this is the greatest album ever and i'm
like okay
again opinion yeah for sure for sure if
you think it is you think it is
yeah yeah but i think at that point you
might be biased
yeah yeah yeah but it's like people if
you think that this
album is genuinely terrible and there is
no musical
oh yeah concept behind it or it there's
no good sound
yeah then i'm like okay you probably
just hate ksi yeah exactly yeah so
yeah it's a bit boss really um but yeah
the next song number two with future in
21 savage
this from every reaction i've watched is
the most mixed song
is it like there's there's mixed songs
but this one because
me personally yeah i think the weakest
person on the song is 21 savage
other people mainly americans
from what i've watched 21 savage carrot
uh carried this one wow
and i'm like what do you think of that
one um i don't i've not really had an
opinion on who carries it really or who
like who had the better i guess part of
the track
again it's hard to do because i've heard
future something i've heard of all i've
heard jj future and international
so many times that it's like they all
sound like they would i expect them to
sound
yeah so no one i just i don't think the
song is the strong one i don't think
it's the strongest on the album
i wouldn't i say it's probably one of my
least favorite on the album which
actually i think
you know it's not it's not a downside on
jj it's more of a downside on
the potential of that track yeah you hit
a future 2017 ksi oh my god
it's gonna be incredible but it wasn't
really whereas you know the first song
at the moment i'm like i prefer that
song yeah a lot of people also said
straight away look at it that's the song
i want to hear yeah
at the end of it they were like that's
one of the only songs i wouldn't
replay constantly yeah yeah um futures
part though to me
is so good i i
but his part in that i was literally
like i wish this was its own song that's
what you
yeah that's where you find like the best
or the best for a reason because they
can go on any track
like again like you know i mean not to
sound peak on jj but you know
say when future's going to go in the
studio and work with say a drake collab
you imagine you'd probably put a bit
more into it than you would say a ksi
one whereas no future doesn't do that
he's just
he's future on every song that's what i
noticed about this album though is
i like listening through it
i don't think there's a single person on
it that
sounds out of place or sounds like they
phoned it in sound
yeah sounds like they went oh yeah yeah
just gets money
yeah yeah yeah i think that's right
that's why they are the best i mean
credit to jd for even getting these
features but
you know again like obviously i imagine
i imagine i
don't know how it really works i don't
say too much but future would have been
like someone have been like our future
johnny go on this song or like let's do
a song he's probably like yeah sure like
he goes for it where's a lot of people
like oh what ksi i don't want to do that
so i credited them all you know well the
next one's patience
which we've obviously yeah it's an old
song
i think when i do my reaction i'm gonna
i'm gonna do like a i've obviously heard
the album already i was driving when i
first heard it but i'm gonna do like a
maybe like a
listen through probably would skip those
ones yeah
i didn't listen to on stream yeah um
and i listened to them but if i was to
listen to the album now
i think i'd skip the ones i've heard a
lot you're not out of dislike
just because you're excited to hear the
new stuff yeah i don't want to hear
like i i hear really love or whatever
yeah with the radio every single time
yeah yeah you do every album like if
you've heard a single you skip it
because it's lighter on this album as
well no okay yeah
i don't is that his song
well it's probably it's one of those
instances where it's like
but similarly to like how patience is a
co song as well if that makes sense
same with like really love so it's kind
of like a you know we're going to get
together and do this collaboratively a
lot of artists do it these days
you know you scratch my back i scratch
yours yeah uh
you is next it's chuckle randolph yeah
john thanks j do you have to do that
which everyone
in my stream said was about me because
the lyrics are
you i do it all for you yeah this is the
song that was actually going to be
released instead of holiday yeah it was
i think it was a rat call 100 definitely
right 100 but this one
i listened to on stream and i went yeah
it's growing like you said in the chat
right good but that's it yeah
and then it's actually watching people's
reactions to it
i like every time i heard it more and
more i was like okay i need to watch
directions
it's a little bit more of a popper and
more of a problem yeah i still think for
me i like it's probably
i'm not massive the biggest fan of it i
think like as a song it's really good
like the song writing but i
kind of it's not my favorite style to
hear jj if that makes sense
i prefer he's more um it's more rap
songs and also he's more like rap
singing songs that make sense so like
the moment you know he's singing in nap
it's more of like a reserve singing
whereas in you to be fair to me goes
through it and does well
yeah but i just that that tone i'm not
the master fan of it um but i think as a
song
it is a bop but i don't think holiday
was the better choice as a single oh 100
yeah uh don't play really love yeah
they're both good songs both very good
yeah uh gang gang this is the one that i
like
everyone was like this is my favorite
one yeah that's my favorite but i do
like it
that is sick although i actually
i'm gonna have a little little i don't
know what the
word is yeah on i listened to it
firstly jay one's verse is sick yeah
it's so much better than his own person
yeah yeah
but i listen to that song and you know
at the end dino starts just going like
stop playing
it and starts going off yeah the beat
changes et cetera
on the stream i'm kind of there like oh
like whoa i didn't i didn't expect this
listening to it again i'm actually like
kind of not like that part
it doesn't fit the song yeah the song is
quite fast-paced and it's like
like yeah i think this song and then
there's this random extra bit
i think this song for me is like it's a
very good song but it's
also very like it's a very generic uk in
track that makes sense
yeah it's a very safe uk track and i
think there's a lot of songs recently in
the
current climate in the uk if you're not
from uk might not know as much but
it's quite like uh that song's gonna do
well whereas
the rest of the album to be fair to jj
and a lot of the other clever
collaborators as well
we're outside the box like it's all over
the place that's the type of album where
it definitely does definitely just
expand a bit like i think it could even
could have been very easy for jada to
play it safe on this album completely
and do songs like this
yeah and it's still been a great album
but it'd been like oh i can't really see
much progression whereas
again good song but i think for me it's
like that it's just a
good it's a great song but it's just a
it is just that it's one of them ones
that you expect to see
on like maybe like grm daily yeah yeah
the video is them in a warehouse with a
couple cars yeah yeah for one shot and
then yeah another shot with some cool
lights
yeah like it's it's very it's very good
but it is also kind of generic yeah you
make it like you know it's gonna do well
yeah it's a safe yeah but it is good
though it still looks good it's yeah
it's one of those
things everyone just listened to i think
swerve is the same as well i think
swerves another one of those like kind
of safe songs but i do play this a lot
more than swerve
like yeah yeah yeah oh yeah for sure
uh the next one's rent-free with gracie
i like this i listened to this on stream
and i was like this is the best song in
the album the worst song
yeah okay but then i listened again
after and again
and again i was like yeah i like it it's
grown on me i thought it
the reason i didn't like it was because
the beat and the chorus
i was like you've got this chorus and
then you've got this beat
yeah yeah i was like what's going on but
then i've
i've learned to like it a lot yeah i
like it actually yeah it's really
different well it's one of those ones
really
as well like a lot of the tracks you've
got jj kind of here and there but this
one you really feel like you get you get
to know him a bit more like he actually
goes
you know in depth in the verses which i
like a lot
then there's madness this song is this
is [ __ ] v
i don't know if we've ever spoken in the
podcast but he just played his beat to
us and i was like i think we both like
we've heard this before
yeah and the sample the piano i think it
is i've definitely 100 percent heard it
before
i'll say i'm on a splice a lot i'm
looking through samples to make beats
laughs i'm like i know this sample i've
either made a beat before
with that sample or i've heard it from
somewhere and i know you said the same
as well
it might have just been him playing it
here a long time ago or maybe when we
were recording something before
he played that beat a long time ago and
it just stuck with me but i've
definitely heard it somewhere
and i was not sure if it's somewhere
else or him
yeah i have no idea but it's a banger
because that's something i hear
everything just like through the wall
which is like very muffled
and i'm like i heard this song so like
every song that played i was like
old versions of like patience remember
that yeah maybe madness as well
yeah um silly
banger it's the one bugsy oh yeah sorry
yeah bang
this song like to go after madness
madness made me want to just
like punch a baby
like i was i was ready to just yeah yeah
yeah
and then silly would be like my victory
walk after punching yeah what's up [ __ ]
like yeah how'd you like this
oh the police can try and stop me bro
yeah silly's playing you can't stop me
my first listen to this car was when i
was driving back from somewhere so like
sometimes song will come on i don't know
what it's called but you know
books have killed us as well bugs killed
it that's what i mean though
yeah that's what i mean about people
like their features though yeah he gave
it
gave us all yeah yeah that song is so
good i
i wish i had a car just so i could uh my
favorite thing is listening to a new
album in the car yes
i did yeah a whole different style of
listening to yeah i was driving back and
i was like
obviously we spoke before like maybe
i'll do like a reaction to it but i was
like nah i want to listen to it i'm
driving back got two hours to kill it's
perfect
time to listen to album it was really
warm as well it's like windows down
i always like listen to my songs or like
jj's songs or something i know with the
windows down as well
so i'm like listen to my friend walking
fast walking the dog i'm like yeah [ __ ]
listen to this
uh we got flash it with rico i love this
song
i like it i love this song i just felt
like it wasn't jj's song
well yeah i do get that i mean ricky
look so there's those who don't enrico
look he's like a big big
songwriter he's written songs like
beyonce rihanna
big big big song right like he's pretty
written something like your favorite
song if you don't even notice him
yeah i didn't yeah i mean but i i i i
like a song like it's
a very like album filler definitely a
filler but i just like the vibe of
it it also made me like my hips started
to move
oh yeah you know i mean like the song
played and i was a bit like oh
yeah yeah i feel this uh then
two songs later no pressure comes on and
my hips start
hitting each wall i love this song i
didn't think blood pressure was i don't
think i would have i
was i was listening to it like i don't
think it's my vibe but then day after
i'm like i'm putting that song on again
and jade that song is the one that
that's the one that
made me stop my stream right and
literally just go like
i haven't heard this yeah what the [ __ ]
is it but it's good
yeah because it it's straight away it's
like you have that
it's just a completely different sound
yeah i went
well this isn't ksi a lot of the time
that we would we were recording
in the past for jj there's times where
he'd go outside of his comfort zone and
i'd be like oh man like do you want to
do that because i i'd always be like
you know focus on what you can do best
but he's like now you know
push the boundaries and two fade does
that and then in the song he does that
and it really really works so
it's a credit to him as well for
actually pushing it um you're looking up
rico love song i am yeah i just want to
like read some out it's mad you know
um so this is not necessarily just uh
this is songwriting production credits
um
so you've got uh wait
should show it from new to old just top
top

i believe natasha benefield enough sick
guys so shout out to rico love man
okay well after after the rico love song
yeah
is our favorite our favorite song on the
album oh yeah
no time with little dirk it's not even a
question either like it's like
it's the best i've put in my instagram
stories the best character house ever
yeah and not and not just because of a
little dirk either like sometimes you'll
say like you know say like you're like
okay it's very like a very pop song you
know you can tell it's maybe influence
about some of the people
this one's like jj's character song this
song that
like you say not would look like not
because of little dude still smashed it
i actually forget little ducks on the
song
until i listen to it and it's like a
nice surprise yeah and he did very very
well it's not even like he was not good
on the song he's incredible no no he's
amazing
but i lit i play it and the first the
first chorus happens and i'm like oh my
god i love this song then you have jj's
first and i'm like that was a sick voice
yeah yeah you have the chorus again and
i'm like oh my god this song is amazing
then
little duck comes on and go oh my god i
forgot he's on the side yeah it's so
amazing
there's a reason this was going viral on
tick tock when it was like leaked or
it's a snippet or whatever yeah
and we all said like you have to make
this the single like you have to make
even jayla's like really i'm not even
like the management was like
yeah we're like no this song is the best
it's by by far the best so i watched
i think it was dante yeah and then
there's also a smaller streamer called
uh wesley who basically they both
listen to the album on stream both of
them
heard the song and it's like a
really thing to me
yeah that bit that literally happened
and both of them
yeah this is the song this is the song
i've heard the clip
they were like this was at the outro of
one of the videos like in the background
i said it sounds amazing
yeah i'm listening to jj's most played
songs right over the last like say 28
days whatever okay
uh it's just spotify holiday obviously
patience don't play lighter really love
and then no time yeah next one is
number two well swerve but yeah number
two but swerves like
someone else's song as well number two
then yeah in the moment yeah i think
gang gang too fair
yeah i'm not gonna i had this
conversation with jj okay yeah
he was like i said how every streamer
i've watched who's wretched the album
has said this
this is the best song did he just didn't
believe his [ __ ] huh
does he believe us yet yeah he is there
like yeah it's getting the reception
from everybody yeah yeah like those
first five songs mentioned they're all
like charts off in singles that they've
been out for months so they're going to
be played that many people but this one
it's not single and it's like out
performance so i know little dirk is
huge
but he's to be phased he's probably
bigger than a lot of people think
oh no 100 but it's not because it's not
he's not the only reason
he's not because it's now overtaken
future and 21 savage yeah together yeah
yeah yeah that's the one everyone wanted
to
hear and then this one is so sick man
and then it's no pressure
and then the only then it's holiday
which obviously we've spoken about yeah
then it's sleeping with the enemy
which that's a banger as well it was a
beat on it it's really weird though in
it
how it goes from like it's like i guess
well the chorus is big isn't it
it's what you're trying to say versus
it's also like the tune
almost feels like a christmas jingle
yeah yeah i get how that would be
that style of being no i like it i like
it but it's just like the start
it does sound almost like a because you
know how he does the
um i told my mom i was
quitting school yeah yeah she laughed
and said and he even does the laugh yeah
and i was like this sounds like a play
yeah okay and then it kind of goes in a
bit it is the only one i feel like you
get
that full story yeah true yeah you get a
bit about him in other songs but this
one is the one that's
my heartfelt yeah yeah well i do think
the second like i saw someone
this was one of the only songs where i
saw someone's like comment on it before
it came out
which obviously affects your opinions
you trying to see any spoilers but
someone said oh
the second verse goes so hard but when i
listen to us actually like i actually
prefer the first half
the first verse sorry because the first
part is like very storytelling and the
second one he goes like a few melodies
but i'm kind of like
i enjoyed because the beat is so like um
the beat reminds me of
you know who's the
come on give me some so hard you know
back in the day there's the uh
give me something bruno mars featured on
it okay it was like a
yeah it was travis similar to bobby very
close now okay
travis mccoy driving mccoy from what jim
clara yeah jim that's not jim carter
yeah
it felt like that kind of type of beat
like just like like a
you know that period where it was
literally there yeah yeah
that type of song is like a very like
piano very
crisp beat and you got like sick vocals
over the top it's kind of like pure rap
yeah like eminem airplanes playful
yeah yeah yeah playful rapping and sx
comes in huge chorus blah blah blah and
in the second verse i'm like get back
into that flow again but still got a
song
yeah but that's the whole whole album
yeah um
i'm just i'm happy it's out yeah same i
feel like he's he's now obviously very
busy
uh but this is like it's
it's getting less yeah because you know
obviously you do all the press building
up to it
you do all the press after it and then
he'll kind of have a break a bit
yeah um he's like we're not filming
simon videos for
two and a half weeks because of the
press yeah yeah because he was so busy
that's why
some people have gone away yeah yeah you
got breaks yeah so
he's the only one that doesn't get the
break because obviously he gets a break
from simon videos but not
because he is doing more work yeah i bet
right now he'd
wish for a seven video yeah he managed
to
like i know there was something the
other day he had like a bunch of
interviews
and then the next day had a bunch of
interviews and he basically just said
like
just try and get these ones in the
morning get moved this one to the
night yeah and then he has a day off
yeah yeah because he was just like i
just want a day to
not have to do well yeah he's paying off
that he's working really hard but he's
reaping the rewards you know that's for
sure and you know he knows what he needs
to do to get places so yeah
don't get me wrong i'm not saying like
you should feel sorry for it no no not
at all yeah
right he's he's doing very well from it
yeah but when when i say i mean you work
really hard as well but
when when we me and sound like oh busy
week his like
busy week yeah well his is his always
just he has to go to stuff
yeah which i think yeah for me
personally like i find that the most
tiring thing yeah you could film 12
you could film like 12 videos in a day
and after that i've done really well
today whereas he has to like
it sounds like a it sounds like i'll get
over yourself he has to like you know
get the train
get the car do this do that fly here fly
there and travel in
you probably know you know you got a
holiday right you have to get up at like
4 a.m to get the flight you know you
feel like oh
i'm worn out now but at least i can
relax that's what it's like when you do
these type of press things but non-stop
what was it on we were where was it was
it a sidemen shoot or something
it was something and he no it was his
album night
sorry it was the night the album came
out yeah i was live streaming
oh it was like 1 30 and he came in yeah
just
he was streaming himself on instagram um
so obviously he stayed up till like 2
a.m doing this
live stream to promote his album and
then he comes into my stream and i was
kind of there like i feel bad firstly
you can't hear the music
yeah you can't stand there and just
you'd be bored
secondly he's getting up at 6am to go
see lorraine
yeah mad not because they're dating
that's a weird rumor you know
people people think ksi and lorraine are
dating um
i wish because that means i could meet
lorraine you can meet anyway i'm sure
i want to meet i if i could choose
people to have dinner with i'd actually
choose lorraine
now you know you instagram and like you
got a new approach on life more
opportunities maybe you can do that
because you also i don't want to go on
lorraine
no yes that's part of it it's part of
the thing i ain't doing anything
mainstream like that anything mainstream
like media i'm not doing that well you
got now you said you haven't seen
different media that's different that's
that's
comfortable because that is like
oh hey let's go look at his old gta
videos
oh never mind well you got to do you got
to step out your comfort zone more then
to create something worth talking about
in your mind i i
think yeah you can talk about yeah but i
mean like
i would love to just talk to lorraine
weird bro why she seems so nice i don't
really know
that well but i mean neither do i
remember seems like you know a lot about
have you never seen lorraine no i feel a
bit but not enough for like oh my god i
want to meet that woman
she's awesome yeah well fair enough i
take your head for it but okay
i don't know if i want to go for a meal
i mean i i do if you wanna go for real
that i'm not going to turn it down all
right
you want to go for a meal with jay-z
have you met him
it could be a [ __ ] could be does
anyone has anyone that you
know met him but like for me like jay-z
is obviously like an
artist business person someone i look up
to like take a lot of inspiration
same as lorraine for what though for
being a [ __ ] legend so surely
if you love what she does and she's a
legend because of what you've seen of
her on show
on her show sure you want to go on a
show i'd love to go on a show
if the downside wasn't
other people if there wasn't a third
party that just want to leech and
drag people down jj is surviving
yeah jj is different he's very strong
one of the things he just hates doing is
like not
doing what someone else wants him to do
but i guess yeah that that in a sense
he's got very he's got his own core
beliefs right it's very hard to like
overcome someone overcome that i'm way
i'm very stubborn
as i'd say no to a lot of things whereas
he he does it you know like
he goes to the shoes he hates it imagine
here imagine getting at 6 a.m even
you know love going on the rain but
imagine going to have to do that then
this interview then there's a macro in
your face and that and take a picture
you know well that's what the main thing
is that's why it's tiring i know
obviously
us saying like oh he travels a bit yeah
i know everyone's like oh i travel to
work like i travel
she's just normal but it's the fact of
he travels to it
and then immediately the second he's out
of the car
it's you have to be ksi now you have to
be like oh hey hey blah blah blah you
can't
you can't be in a bad mood no like if
you go to work obviously
i'm not i'm not trying to compare the
two but if you go to work you can be in
a bad mood you get your work done yeah
just put your head down
he's literally like everyone is there to
see what you're about to do yeah and you
have to be
perfect yeah because one you know he
does one bad thing
we'll move on to the ksi show yeah yeah
that was a horrible transition but yeah
well yeah
and people people just get angry at him
yeah
i mean well do you did you watch the ksi
show
so i've seen a lot of it but i didn't
watch it live because i was at
uh talia's mum's birthday oh banging
that was a weird weird choice of words
to throw out there after that
would it be if titan wasn't so hot
never would it though that wouldn't have
real
it wouldn't really know like if you was
if you said to me i was at my mom's
birthday and i was like banging no
one was gonna find that weird no but
it's also because you paused
you went banging well never realized
that like you know
anyway um but yeah so i've seen a lot of
it and obviously we were in it
yeah just i bought a ticket obviously
for it now as my brothers at the time we
were having food
at like a barbecue and um i was watching
it and then i was like i saw it beerus
and that i was like i gotta drive home i
have to drive home it's like an hour an
hour drive
so i was like oh watch it i won't get
back i like rewind it and like you can't
no i was like what the [ __ ] i paid for
this there is a there is a re-showing
tuesday
wednesday now yeah it's yesterday and
either thursday if you bought it or
you could still buy it as well but no i
mean
i think to be fair like i think jd was
writing he saw his video i think
did you watch it on your stream today
yeah yes i think to be fair as well like
it's a tough one because a lot of the
criticism and the hate is like
unwarranted
but at the same time there are a lot of
people who have got genuine like
worries with it and i think he took it
well and like he's like you know fair
enough like
yeah my my two things that i took from
obviously so i
i watched his reddit video if you
haven't seen it it's very funny
yeah um he basically just goes through
the reddit of people
slating the show well that was his read
it wasn't it wasn't even like
yeah but all the comments as well were
i'll watch him not do a reddit video
this week and
avoid it and then he'll come back when
the reddit is different
and that's what every artist would do
yeah for sure but obviously jj doesn't
well damage control in it
the labels don't reply to this don't
reply to that yeah it's like no
criticism when yeah like as you're gonna
say fair play to him to just
that's what i mean you gotta give him
props anyway like even if you hate him
or hate the show
yeah you've got to accept he literally
has reacted to everyone's hate
and replied yeah he hasn't just gone
like oh yeah
[ __ ] you you're stupid he's actually
like explained everything about you yeah
well and the two things that i basically
took from it which i do agree with
is firstly he said it was 90 minutes
yeah yeah it was about 70.
he would have not known that though like
nah but if you don't know it you
shouldn't say it
it's true it's true yeah if you don't
know how long it is
you might have been told like it's 90
minutes and then when it was all i had
it down it was 70 and like
true but if you went to a girl and
you're like oh by the way
i do have a six inch penis and it was
like it was like four inches
yeah and she's like oh that wasn't that
wasn't really what you said yeah yeah
you're like
oh to be fair i actually never measured
it i just kind of guess
you're right you're right yeah yeah yeah
yeah i get you so that was one of the
issues which in the video he literally
says that's my bad
i just got it wrong the other one was
what was the other one the other one was
that he oversold it because it was way
more music
because he said it will break the
internet
i think and ultimately no matter what
i i struggle to think of many things
that will break the internet
yeah i think the only people who have
like
yeah it's a hard one too i think like
what was the king called actually one at
a time where
the paper magazine you know she's like i
had the champagne stuff like that yeah i
think it was corporate the internet
yeah that was only because they called
it really interesting yeah and and it's
a hard one i think
logan fighting floyd mayweather is the
like the crossover of everything
yes jj got a lot of celebrities in it
but
i don't want to i don't want to like
slate it because firstly i haven't seen
it secondly
uh well i would have seen it by the time
this is out yeah but
i would have liked
for it to have been less skit
and more story yeah because obviously
it's meant to be
chaos a story with music and a lot of it
was mute everyone also said
i felt like i just watched a musical
show thing is that again that's it's
going to be like your own
subjectiveness or your own your own like
imagination of what the show is because
it's called the ksi show right like show
a show could mean
tv show or it could mean a musician yeah
and also like
it was heavily promoted with artists
like for the last two week three weeks
have been promoting like artists in it
all the way and on the banner of it it's
literally just artists like
he did also promote lorraine jonathan
yeah
yeah yeah for sure and he also promoted
it as
oh it's gonna be my story
yeah with some music yeah if it promoted
it as
the concert it's going to be a musical
concert with some skits between
i think people would have gone that's
what we expected
i think i think yeah i think one thing i
do agree with a bit is that like the the
like the the scriptures parts that at
times they were quite cringe
yeah i mean in general is an opinion it
is yeah
but he i don't know what it
i if i mean if i was going to write it
not write it if i was going to
direct it myself and i could change so i
could i obviously know what i know now
yeah yeah yeah i would have
made it
like a conversation with heskey but 10
minutes of him talking to him
what happens yeah yeah yeah but i have
pre-prepared questions which are what
people want to know
and it's way more like way more personal
yeah
then you have the songs of that era yeah
then you have him
talking to i don't know who you would go
next but maybe
maybe like someone like sway or someone
like yeah yeah like you go
you do the same as you go through his
time period like this obviously like you
would end with
logan but you would then have him and
logan in the room for 10 minutes what
happens
and you just say like oh who won the
fight
yeah let them talk yeah yeah yeah yeah
and if this isn't meant to be funny it's
not meant to be them kind of
like oh you know it's literally
that's the story and then you get some
of his music yeah or it'll be like that
it'll be like
hesky music this person and that's his
story yeah yeah
do that or let him write it like because
i think
the whole point of ksi and the whole
reason is even doing well right now
because again like
if he wasn't ksi his album would just be
not no it would it would be less noise
about it but oh yeah another it's just
not another album
because it's ksi people people are like
so drawn to it and
i think if you're going to be like you
know the ksi show is my story then let
him dictate it because
throughout his whole whole career that's
what he's done best is he's you know
dictated his own career like and that's
why his immigrant position is in now
like he's inspired a lot of people
and showing them you can go from like
this like the nerdy kid in the bedroom
to what he's doing now
but he's done that for himself and no
one else has like yeah maybe like now
the labels are helping him get to the
point you know putting him on this
getting there getting that opportunity
that's what they do best but he's still
been this the whole person getting him
sort of into those positions i think the
show would have been you know much
better if it was like right
jj what when you can tell it was kind of
like
you know it was people's perception of
jj written rather than his perception of
himself
like and you can tell a lot like the
jokes it's kind of like well that's what
one of the posts
in the reddit video is um
american dad writers calling him a
fatnik
for the sixth time i have achieved
comedy yeah yeah and it's like it did
from what i've seen it did feel like
it was a bunch of old suits
looking at his audience what it was that
yeah and now you look back on it and
it's like i think the reason they were
so
big on like americans that have written
this or sorry
some of the writers from america that
showed some of the jokes is so that it's
like a
cushion to fall on yeah oh look it's
american that it has to be good
whereas like i think even if it may have
been less proper or less
less you know professionally correct i
think having jaded dictate that would
have been so much better
because you know because i know i know
obviously the directors of american dad
or whatever have
all the writers yeah have written other
stuff that
i think anyway is real life but if
they're known for american dad
comment like trying to write a comedy
skit that's
a cartoon
the american writers are massive ksi
fans they might not know they definitely
don't know a story from the star
as much as he does or maybe someone else
closer to him would know
so they are gonna miss you know and also
he's got an
album to write i can't imagine he's
there with a fine tooth comb going like
i'll take his butt out take that out
he's got you know but you know i think
and that's what i think a lot of the
criticism was fair i think he's in a
position now where
he's ready and his core fan base are a
big reason to where he's at now like
yeah
you know if he gets a number one thing
he replies to it though exactly yeah
exactly that's what that's what i'm
saying yes
like the fact that you know he even says
you know maybe i took out on this one
like
you have to respect that because you
know they're the reason why he's in this
position now
and you know they've also got a right to
have that opinion i see a lot of people
have been like
don't hate on him for no reason and i'm
like well a lot of people aren't
necessarily hating the show
yeah i mean i've seen people on twitter
and stuff i've seen people say it's a
scam and i'm like no no
you don't understand what a scam is if
you think that's a scam yeah like your
scam would have been
oh everyone buy my shirt it's gonna be
the best thing in the world yeah
give me gives your money and just
doesn't have a show yeah that's when
it's a scam where half of
yeah and half of the reddit was like
just jokes as you would expect even if
the show was a massive success
there's still be jokes like our fact
this fact that you know it's just part
of reddit it's what reddit is and his
culture and his
his audience is but also you can tell a
lot of people were given actual
criticism like some people like is what
i like about it is what i don't like and
making lists and it was constructive so
in this day and age as well you can't
all you can't always assume that
someone's are trying to cancel him for
this it
is just a fair opinion you know and him
being in his position he has to
go through his reddit and show the good
parts but also the bad parts and i think
he handled it really well
so credit to him i mean a lot of people
that
there were there were a lot of people
who still loved it yeah for sure because
i i thought it was great i mean you can
see the the like
the budget behind it and the production
and everything is
amazing yeah and the musical part
they're my favorite part the music part
is my favorite part like i
i i i've got i think the some parts of
the acting was a bit cringe but i think
like
because of the writing i think it was
nice how they were in there but i i
would have probably preferred it if it
was maybe just a concert
um but maybe that's my episode as an
artist i prefer that stuff
yeah but i think it's just it all just
depends on how it's sold
yeah right yeah if it's sold as like if
it was sold as like an online virtual
concert
then yeah yeah and everyone would you
can't complain if it's just music no
but i think it's just i think it's just
basically people
i mean it's the same as the sidemen show
yeah was very scripted
everyone was like i think i like it but
it's just not that funny well yeah ask
me if you if what do you prefer
the the simon show or like a seven
sunday i'll just say it's happening
sunday that's what i mean yeah and it
doesn't take away from the production or
what the seven show was it's just like
like
it's the same way people probably some
people will prefer to have and react to
seven sunday
that's just what they enjoy right it's
just there to have a content and i think
that's where a lot of the criticism
maybe or
other a lot of the disappointment from
fans came from is like they're treated
every sunday
to like an incredible cyber sunday
incredible video and then maybe they're
getting charged like
15 pounds to see something that's like
in their opinion shorter and maybe worse
subjectively
they're probably like oh well i could
have just watched you know next week
side on sunday
so that's the part of it as well but
that's not jj's fault that's actually a
credit to him because he's given so much
free content for the past
two and a half well one and a half
decades you know or maybe
that's the other thing i feel like
everyone who's bought it
is probably a big enough fan of him
that they've been watching him for years
yeah and that's why
kind of i'm not i'm not trying to defend
him i'm not trying to like kiss his ass
or anything because
i saw a lot of people like if i
basically if we say anything good about
the show everyone goes oh you're just
kissing his ass
well what do you say we all buy it we're
all we're our basketball yeah
but ultimately if you just take it now
as like oh you've paid 18 pounds
or whatever it was 15 pounds for all his
content over the years
still a very good deal yeah it's still a
very good deal for sure yeah
you got remember as well i mean like
what like discord nitro is like 10k a
month
yeah would you get like just a funny gif
i was like you know
and then also they put a lot of money
into that i think it was publicly public
knowledge or they put a lot of money
into this yeah so like
you gotta recuperate really and like
yeah maybe maybe you can look at that
and think yeah but
maybe i was it was a bit much for what i
got but the next time i says you know
you've also had so much free content
beyond the years and um
this is why i asked though in my stream
i said so
to everyone who didn't like it would you
have like everyone that's vocally hating
it
would you be vocally hating it if it was
free
and all of them said no yeah and i'm
saying okay well if you wouldn't be
vocally hating it now
because it's free then the content can't
be that bad
yeah you hate it you're just annoyed the
fact that you've paid for it
yeah so be angry at that all you want
that's fair but don't start saying like
oh i got scammed because it was
[ __ ] blah blah blah there was that one
funny comment in his video where they
were like um i didn't even pay for this
enough but still feel scared
yeah that's just banner isn't it yeah
yeah it's the same way it's like you
know
currently under his tweets and people
just copy and paste stuff and they're
just doing it for
for tweets for attention yeah they don't
actually mean it but um
yeah i think in general i think it's
like like he said in his videos well
it's not even an l really for me it's
like it's just maybe not so much it's
not a
it's not so much it's not an l as much
as it's like a weak w
like it's still the whole point of it is
still to promote this album and it has
done that like
yeah like i hate the show it still would
have you know massively benefited the
promotion of his albums so he's what it
is
which didn't live up to i think his
standard standard yeah yeah
but it was the same way simon sunday we
had logan paul in it yeah
fishing with him uh the last couple
weeks
every no one has said
we are doing a sidemen sunday with logan
paul logan has said
uh oh yeah we're linking up with a
sidemen or something like that no so
yeah keemstar said logan is in london
filming a sidemen video no one ever told
him this he just
assumed yeah so my whole point is here
that everyone was angry for the last two
three weeks whatever since he came to
london and we've posted
every week where's logan why isn't logan
here blah blah blah
no one's ever said it you've made the
assumption yourself and now
got angry at something which yeah you've
created yourself a smart assumption
oh yeah but as in like no no yeah you
can't be angry at something that you've
made up like if i go
ah randolph
he farted on my pillow yesterday but i
made that up
it comes i can't be angry because i've
just made it when like
you know uh i've done something bad to
laura in a dream
she's not what the [ __ ] yeah it's a
dream yeah so your own interpretation of
your mind it's like you have made this
yeah assumption up and then got angry
because it hasn't but
your expectations one thing regarding
the logan paul thing is that he was
never ever
the whole point of him being in the show
was meant to be a surprise to jj
yeah but he said on a live stream um
i um so mom's originally messaged me to
like he's like can you please
send them to us can you give logan a
call and actually like put this together
because he didn't do that oh yeah he
didn't want to reach out and obviously
because of the pokemon stuff he was like
maybe he you know so i mentioned logan i
was like
he ain't gonna like he's just gonna
ignore me but to be fair he actually
i've messaged him saying you know jj's
manager got something big
you want to be involved and he said yes
i'd pass the number to mums and then
and then i was like basically saying no
still and then you said yeah
um so yeah credit to logan for even
doing it in the first place but though
he was supposed to be completely pro
it's
meant to be a surprise to jj yeah the
whole point was that he's gonna be in
the show and surprised jj and jj is
gonna be like what the hell is it
that doesn't make sense though because
where in the show what logan's going to
reveal himself you
think of think of the production on that
you're saying that logan is going to be
there
and film with jj and then pull his hood
down and jj's going to genuinely be
shocked if they if it was one take it
would have worked
yeah but i was there when you did your
the the seven part it wasn't one take
no thirty five takes i think we showed
you in the bloopers where he like throws
the
sushi everywhere but yeah but i think in
general it's just gonna be like a nasty
prize for jj but then logan in the live
stream was like
i might have done the work says with ksi
out of the simon and then that's when
jj asked ma'am just like why she said
this and obviously mum's that point has
to be like well this is what happens
what's happening
well the other thing about the ksi show
even if you hate it
um the only reason we've now collabed
with logan paul is because of that yeah
logan came over
specifically for the ksi show and then
we
we had already planned that weekend we
were like oh we're gonna decide sunday
we're just gonna go fishing we were like
people asked us to funny video sure
let's do it
did that um had the ksi show and we
we went it's a real shame logan is
coming all the way to london we're not
doing simon sunday with him that is such
a
waste yeah yeah so we went what have we
got
especially being involved with ksi as
well like if you obviously if you just
came to london for like something else
it's gonna be different because he's
actually being involved with one of the
members of the side man then you know
yeah exactly so we we were there like
what we got we got fishing [ __ ] it
should we just invite logan paul
to go fishing with us ethan texted him
and
uh he's like oh hey man no you're in
london obviously if you're busy whatever
that's calm
uh we're doing assignment sunday we're
going fishing if you if you're down
as [ __ ] yeah nice yeah and we're like
wait what we didn't expect him to reply
it just worked there you got him like
logos from uh
higher rise like you know i'm sure he
was lost fishing
he does we were very like he probably
won't reply
okay ethan wasn't even sure if it was
the right number still all right okay
you never know how
often people change number or whatever
yeah well i probably won't reply then he
says he replies he says that
we're like what the what the hell we're
actually gonna do this video
then i was i was very like
i will believe it when i see he he might
not turn it up
i think it's very he hasn't asked much
about details you know tanya
our like manager basically or like
personal manager kind of thing started
organizing it with their team yeah yeah
we were kind of like okay
we'll wait and see that they turn up
just because
they're hella busy jet lagged they're
doing the ksi show for a day or two
whatever yeah they're leaving literally
the morning
after it they might just wake up and be
like sorry dad's like
yeah which is fair i wouldn't blame him
yeah but you gotta remember like you are
the cyberman and
he is ksi like yeah yeah but he's done
the ksi part and he's probably a slight
shot he went
i'm not saying he would bail on that i'm
just saying like the sidemen part was
very like
lackluster do you want to go fishing
forever imagine in america right imagine
you go to la
um and oh i guess well now puerto rico
was taken in l.a right and you're like
oh man you're just filming going there
for film you're in there for a reason
not just a holiday
and logan paul texture is like you want
to come go quiet you can like yeah
like yeah but he sees you the same way
you see him like it's just now but
i that's the thing i don't see that
because i think
like for me even being on his go-karting
video
is a way bigger opportunity for me than
him being an assignment but in your
opinion he might see it differently he
might think oh man like you can't
remember like
so it's logan paul yeah one of one of
the biggest people you know stars in the
world but so
sad men are all that as well and so jj
so he's like he might be you know
not only is he thinking now that we
might not be fun to go you know fishing
with you lot
you know it's also like oh man it's a
good opportunity for me which it is
look at the comments look at everyone
logan's so chill now logan you know
what a great guy is it's good business
choice him as well he would want to do
it anyway
because he's a cool guy but also like
it's smart for him as well
makes sense he was actually obviously as
i said before i'd met him for
nine seconds after one of the fights
yeah and he just said hi
he's actually a very very nice guy he is
um and
yeah i think he i i'm not gonna lie i
think he was very disappointed with the
fishing
because he said like oh yeah i go
fishing quite a bit yeah he was quite
excited and he was like yeah we normally
you know
we're catching big ass fish american
fish yeah yeah
whereas here we were catching like
little baby sharks
like stinky little stingray and a little
starfish
and a bag and a bag come back
but the video guess where it is out of
ten one
shock well i saw you can ask me those
numbers yeah
so i'll give you context what i've seen
so far so i've seen the sidemen tweet
of it being like four million views or
six million views in like four hours
what was it sorry something like that
but right well i'll tell you right now
it's been out for one day
three hours so 27 hours
number two is the
holiday video 5.9 extreme cook-off is
also on 5.9
which is funny because that one
supposedly got those hey yeah
this is on 7.9
so basically 8 million views in just
over a day
that is disgusting here's disgusting
that is disgusting
it's actually that's
unbelievable i was gonna make a joke
earlier on the podcast that um as i
asked r7 can i join the sidemen
and you'll be like no say no no oh man
i wish i was so i could afford some good
air conditioning that was gonna be my
joke
it wasn't great wasn't it no that's why
i had no relevance to
absolutely anything i just think you
know i'm always here i was like um
what's the funny thing to open the
podcast with and that wasn't what i was
gonna go with but
it didn't explain that you don't have
air conditioning you didn't explain oh
yeah
i don't i don't have air conditioning
it's been hot it's been hot it's been
hard in the uk
yeah i'm i'm agreeing that i wasn't the
joker i went with i didn't go with it
i'm just saying you know that's what
wasn't
one of my jokes so the reason i was
looking at the distance i was gonna try
and fit into that i was like i wish i
had eight million views
imagine if you paid 18 pounds for that
18 months for that i would complain
yeah you know you know here's what it is
though i don't know what else we have to
talk about
what else has happened yeah what's good
questions
you want uh we can leave them we'll
leave them for a guess yeah um
what else has happened you don't watch
love island which is a bit sad
no it's not it is it's it's it's it's
not that you watch it it's a cultural
thing
i don't watch it because i'm there like
oh i can't wait to see who they pick
no but we used to be like that i used to
be like that i'm allowed to say it's
fallen off
oh it has fallen off yeah but there's
still moments
this is not there is there is still
moments the people aren't
there is still ksi at the moment true
well actually can't believe that i can't
believe
how many people apply to love island now
versus say two years ago and how they
still like mess up the casting
yeah just how it is
yeah um
i mean that's pretty much it you know
love island obviously
but you don't watch that ksi show we got
jj's album
i was actually doing a uh
what stream was it i was doing a stream
and rice com
came into my all right he came into my
stream right
and he instantly just kind of went like
oh
like oh look at this guy what's he doing
oh he says cringe etc etc
then he gives me 50 subs i was like
okay what's happened here like what yeah
given me lots of money for
calling me cringe apparently so you
can't ignore him
right right then i loaded up his stream
and i saw that he was just watching me
on
me huge and i was like instantly i was
just like oh hey everyone
watching ricegum make sure you check out
uh m7 education it's a great charity my
brother started up
and then he called me cringe and said
like why is he promoting his [ __ ]
and then stop yeah and i was like wow i
think he's hurting right now ain't he
i don't know i don't know what it is
he's
well i didn't i saw someone say that's
good like can we just leave it to him
and ksi i can yeah
just have their argument and just just
leave the rest of us alone dude well
didn't he admit that julian's just good
or something i saw someone i saw someone
tweet something that said like a
list of chaotic wins you know something
like ricegum
admitting that his music actually is a
higher level than his
yeah he admit he has said at some point
that he was jealous of chaos
okay okay okay but yeah all right but
everyone will probably just say no he
hasn't
um that's that's about it obviously
now actually as well the day we are
recording this
freedom day no more masks no more
restrictions
yeah mad yeah i went into a shop
earlier i thought today
did i say did i not did i say that i
just said that
recording day yeah appointment well i
literally went today
but i thought it was only things where
it's like when the podcast comes out
today
okay yeah masks are now yeah anyways uh
yeah i went into a shop today i got a
little little boost juice
nice um i walked in and i was like i
need to make sure i have my
i have my mask i didn't i looked at
everyone i was like no one's running
their masks i think
some company is a little quieter didn't
they in it said i had to wear it
laura she said do not get the two
because she went to uh i think she into
a massage
massage today and she said her t-shirt
was literally like
you should have dripped in a bath go on
the tube yeah
i think i think i'm still gonna wear a
mask on the tube for the next little bit
just as like a safety yeah i think
everyone out there as well i still let's
be responsible with all this because
like you've seen the numbers the numbers
are getting mad again
and um it's still i think like yeah
still be safe i mean people people have
mass before haven't they i know like i
think in china people
used to wear a lot of masks not
necessarily for viruses i think that's
more for the dust
but in you know same way as like you
know people will still
sanitize their hands when there was
there was no you know yeah
still be safe that's one thing i
definitely need to keep up is
hygiene yeah that's true yeah i mean end
of the day like i think didn't they say
that
in the pandemic i know it's gonna sound
quite contradictory but like
they've said that the regular you know
regular flu cold
has minimized because everyone's wearing
masks and everyone's actually performing
everyone's taking care of themselves
more actually you know performing about
hygiene that the regular colds have
dropped a bit
which would make sense isn't it
obviously cover is still kicking about
but the only thing i hate
is using the anteback
gel i always do it and then i'm like i
want it i want to do it before i ate
obviously because if you do it yeah yeah
then you touch your food and it tastes
gross yeah it's very strong isn't it
yeah you're eating a chip or you like
touch a straw oh it was at the end of
the england game there was a wipe that
was like an anti-bacterial alcohol wife
you know you supposed to wash your hands
and stuff but it was so sweaty at the
game that i used to watch my face
and my face was just burning stinging
stinging yeah but you know i felt clean
[ __ ] clean though so you know me and
josh right
so there's a bit in the show okay the
pre-show when me and josh are on the red
carpet bit
and says toby but that was immediately
after we just got our old people makeup
take off
taken off bro when i'm telling you
me and josh our faces were burned wow
and not like sunburn
it literally his face is bright red
because he
they use like rubbing alcohol yeah and
just do this until it comes off
so our faces went bright red i got it
mainly here around the cheeks he got it
all over his face
yeah for the next couple days like do
you do you moisturize your face when you
yeah yeah yeah we did that and he always
describes it as the scene from home
alone
he literally put moisturizer on his face
and then went
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah honestly that was
the most painful thing i've had
in a while mad yes horrible it was
literally just like touch my face
burn it just oh yeah too i mean i think
both of you
after the show like you face you could
say your face had a bit of reaction to
it yeah
especially very very sensitive very yeah
very
well i guess one thing i would want to
say is three i want to do my little
announcement but i'm nervous now
ladies and gentlemen we have a huge
announcement we do is it a
groundbreaking announcement so the
reason i've been
so busy what that was just funny oh he
literally went yet
we do oh man so the last three or four
months threes i've been so busy
obviously i've not pushed music back um
this is a big exclusive figure that's
the biggest video yeah it's
actually on your channel no it's full
exclusive damn i've teased towards it
but not fully but um obviously you even
want to do some music as well
i've been setting up a studio but i've
pushed everything back right to this one
thing so the last three to four months
been working
tirelessly every week so i drive that's
why i got my car two hours away three
hours away back and forth
working on this big project and it's
right it's time to announce
you know you've got you know you
obviously neither of us had this but
it's like a baby now
i'm so nervous to show off to the world
pretty much obviously i went big into
pokemon
smashed it there obviously logan paul is
in victory as well i was doing bits you
know
this that killing the game he's here and
i went away for a long time i didn't
post much
because i've been physically disappeared
i'm massively proud to announce that we
have
jeez coming soon a new revolutionary
service in the world of pokemon and it
is going to be
a new pokemon grading service
obviously you've got you've got psa out
there you got cgs out there these are
you know
have been great companies over the time
but now you send a card into ps8 takes
it costs 200
and it takes a year i've got cars that
i've done last year and still not back
and also the slabs ugly old-fashioned
however
we have developed a brand new case a
brand new label and a brand new pokemon
grading service
yes we have i am also a 50 stakeholder
in this
yeah no yeah that's why it's called
mint grading because it's named after me
bro that would have been sick
but now it's big uh this friday so in
two days i'll do a the big reveal
shot by john um and con um
your pokemon channel on my pokemon
channel on my instagram i'll be
everywhere i want to
do a big shout out a lot but i'm going
to show you simon the slab today
here now this is a prototype so it's not
a final version
but it's it's close to it okay gee okay
we're not going to show off too much
well the reason i said that is because
he actually showed me to show you i've
shown him before yeah
all these other like all these other
grading services that are starting now
people are thinking i'm going to do this
you can't
you have to do it properly okay i said
to myself i'm not gonna do this i'm not
even gonna be involved in this company
unless
it's done properly okay i can vouch for
this as well he's been
he has been very
that's right vacant i have mentally yeah
now i've
killed this this project has killed me
literally like i'm like a different
person now
yeah but we've built an amazing product
and i can say that like
everyone else who's starting these great
companies you know they're using chinese
cases that are just you know off alibaba
they're using
you know they're all model of the psa
case no originality
we've got you know eight graders been
working for the last two and a half
months training every single day nine to
five to build the perfect service the
perfect actual
you know you know the integrity you need
to have a grading company we're
taking this very very seriously and i
wouldn't even be involved with it if it
wasn't
top of the range and the best it can be
and if it wasn't i would i would say
let's pack it in
let's stop but no it's it's it's gonna
revolutionary and it's better than it's
better than psa it's better than the big
dogs and i think
it is genuinely really sick like i'm not
just saying this because he's here
it is genuinely nicer than psa i'd say
literally yeah like when i felt the case
i was like you know what because
obviously the case
is taking months to get the case done
because everyone else just buys it
offline you know
online story channel in like two seconds
we've taken months to develop this case
and when when i first held it i was like
this is it this feels very premium
that's what you want if you want a
pokemon card right you've pulled it out
of a box or whatever you know talia's
first edition charlotte you want it to
feel
like it's premium because i mean
actually questioned this yeah in the
chat
and randolph sent a video of him
smacking a case against stuff
no damage nothing no damage so it was it
was he
he has worked very hard on this and it
is genuinely
perfected so yeah and uh obviously it's
still the start though so we've still
obviously got plans to grow it and be
even big i think one of the worries that
a lot of these other great companies
have you know is that
the longevity but you know there's been
a lot of money putting this a lot of
time in a lot of investment into this
like that like i said wouldn't have been
done unless we were very serious about
this so yeah i'm very proud so
this friday on socials on my channel et
cetera we're going to be announcing it
properly and you know showing a bit more
about it but
generally it's the best and we're open
very soon like we don't want to announce
and then be like our
you know submissions opening in like six
months we're opening it very soon so
you've got pokemon cards
keep them get ready because you know
we're about to make a storm
i can finally get mine yeah i've got
so many just sat on a shelf it's just
it's just it's been horrible keeping
this in and like i say like it's been
you know certain things have to push it
back but it's so finally nice to be able
to say this and get out there but more
coming as well so
banging so yeah randolph's channels
friday come on check it out friday
yeah yeah i think and again what's good
podcast got the first exclusive

announce and you're like ended

description and also

that's to pay now yeah
that's that's what i was trying to hit
you're not getting this back into it
i'm tweeting this out unless you pay us

um see you guys all next week
potentially
very potentially potentially with jj
because he
will yeah find out by the way he's free

he may even if he does get it there's a
very high chance he's just not free for
a while
we'll try our best yeah we'll try we're
gonna say to him jj you've got number
one run when you said this and if he
says yeah then he'll be here if not
he'll
catch him in the good mood as well yeah
yeah some dinner first yeah watch a film
with him like
by the way a little cuddle yeah yeah
yeah yeah or what we do we say jj you
wanna just come
show something in here right sit him
down john appears from the bathroom or
something
starts recording gotcha [ __ ] you're
live
you know what i actually see him do
other podcasts and stuff and i'm
thinking to myself like
do our podcast bro yeah but he hasn't in
the past and he will
no i don't know he's probably he's the
main reason we still do this doesn't he
just to prove him wrong yeah originally
that's where i came from yeah yeah well
look at this now jj yeah

what actually it can't be the best
without being no no i do agree

best
